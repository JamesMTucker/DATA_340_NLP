    "\n",
    "* `.` matches any character\n",
    "* `^` matches the beginning of the string\n",
    "* `$` matches the end of the string\n",

    "* `+` matches one or more of the preceding character\n",
    "* `?` matches zero or one of the preceding character\n",
    "* `{n}` matches exactly n of the preceding character\n",
    "* `{n,}` matches n or more of the preceding character\n",
    "* `{,n}` matches 0 to n of the preceding character\n",
    "* `{m,n}` matches at least m and at most n of the preceding character\n",
    "* `[abc]` matches any character in the brackets\n",
    "* `[^abc]` matches any character not in the brackets\n",

The most common are `re.search()` and `re.findall()`. `re.search()` will return the first match of a regex in a string. `re.findall()` will return all matches of a regex in a string.

    "> An SBN may be converted to an ISBN by prefixing the digit \"0\". For example, the second edition of Mr. J. G. Reeder Returns, published by Hodder in 1965, has \"SBN 340 01381 8\", where \"340\" indicates the publisher, \"01381\" is the serial number assigned by the publisher, and \"8\" is the check digit. By prefixing a zero, this can be converted to ISBN 0-340-01381-8; the check digit does not need to be re-calculated. Some publishers, such as Ballantine Books, would sometimes use 12-digit SBNs where the last three digits indicated the price of the book;[12] for example, Woodstock Handmade Houses had a 12-digit Standard Book Number of 345-24223-8-595 (valid SBN: 345-24223-8, ISBN: 0-345-24223-8),[13] and it cost US$5.95.[14]\n",

This is to keep\\r\\nthe overhead down, and in response to requests from Gopher site\\r\\nkeeper to eliminate as much of the headers as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, for legal and financial reasons, we must request these\\r\\nheaders be left at the beginning of each file that is posted in\\r\\nany general user areas, as Project Gutenberg is run mostly by a\\r\\ndonation from people like you.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you see our books posted ANYWHERE without these headers, you\\r\\nare requested to send them a note requesting they re-attach the\\r\\nheader, otherwise they have no legal protection and we have the\\r\\nloss of the donations we hope will keep Project Gutenberg going\\r\\nlong enough to post 10,000 books, plays, musical pieces, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***\\r\\nWhy is this \"Small Print!\" statement here?

Among other\\r\\nthings, this means that no one owns a United States copyright\\r\\non or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and\\r\\ndistribute it in the United States without permission and\\r\\nwithout paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth\\r\\nbelow, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext\\r\\nunder the Project\\'s \"PROJECT GUTENBERG\" trademark.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo create these etexts, the Project expends considerable\\r\\nefforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain\\r\\nworks.  Despite these efforts, the Project\\'s etexts and any\\r\\nmedium they may be on may contain \"Defects\".  Among other\\r\\nthings, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or\\r\\ncorrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other\\r\\nintellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged\\r\\ndisk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer\\r\\ncodes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.\\r\\n\\r\\nLIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES\\r\\nBut for the \"Right of Replacement or Refund\" described below,\\r\\n[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this\\r\\netext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all\\r\\nliability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including\\r\\nlegal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR\\r\\nUNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,\\r\\nINCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE\\r\\nOR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE\\r\\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of\\r\\nreceiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)\\r\\nyou paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that\\r\\ntime to the person you received it from.  If you received it\\r\\non a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and\\r\\nsuch person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement\\r\\ncopy.

The\\r\\ncomputers we used then didn\\'t have lower case at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a retranscription of one of the first Project\\r\\nGutenberg Etexts, officially dated December, 1971--\\r\\nand now officially re-released on December 31, 1993--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States Declaration of Independence was the first Etext\\r\\nreleased by Project Gutenberg, early in 1971.  The title was stored\\r\\nin an emailed instruction set which required a tape or diskpack be\\r\\nhand mounted for retrieval.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments\\r\\nlong established should not be changed for light and transient causes;\\r\\nand accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed\\r\\nto suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing\\r\\nthe forms to which they are accustomed.  But when a long train of abuses and\\r\\nusurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce\\r\\nthem under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw\\r\\noff such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.\\r\\n--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now\\r\\nthe necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.\\r\\nThe history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated\\r\\ninjuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment\\r\\nof an absolute Tyranny over these States.  To prove this, let Facts\\r\\nbe submitted to a candid world.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary\\r\\nfor the public good.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate\\r\\nand pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation\\r\\ntill his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended,\\r\\nhe has utterly neglected to attend to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of\\r\\nlarge districts of people, unless those people would relinquish\\r\\nthe right of Representation in the Legislature, a right\\r\\ninestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,\\r\\nuncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their\\r\\nPublic Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them\\r\\ninto compliance with his measures.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing\\r\\nwith manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions,\\r\\nto cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative Powers,\\r\\nincapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large\\r\\nfor their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed\\r\\nto all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States;\\r\\nfor that purpose obstructing the Laws of Naturalization of Foreigners;\\r\\nrefusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither,\\r\\nand raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent\\r\\nto Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has made judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure\\r\\nof their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of\\r\\nOfficers to harass our People, and eat out their substance.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies\\r\\nwithout the Consent of our legislatures.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of\\r\\nand superior to the Civil Power.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction\\r\\nforeign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws;\\r\\ngiving his Assent to their Acts of pretended legislation:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murders\\r\\nwhich they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor imposing taxes on us without our Consent:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring\\r\\nProvince, establishing therein an Arbitrary government,\\r\\nand enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once\\r\\nan example and fit instrument for introducing the same\\r\\nabsolute rule into these Colonies:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws,\\r\\nand altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves\\r\\ninvested with Power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection\\r\\nand waging War against us.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns,\\r\\nand destroyed the lives of our people.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries\\r\\nto compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun\\r\\nwith circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the\\r\\nmost barbarous ages, and totally unworthy of the Head of a civilized nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas\\r\\nto bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of\\r\\ntheir friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has\\r\\nendeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers,\\r\\nthe merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare,\\r\\nis an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress\\r\\nin the most humble terms:  Our repeated Petitions have been answered\\r\\nonly by repeated injury.  A Prince, whose character is thus marked\\r\\nby every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler\\r\\nof a free People.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor have We been wanting in attention to our British brethren.\\r\\nWe have warned them from time to time of attempts by their\\r\\nlegislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.\\r\\nWe have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and\\r\\nsettlement here.  We have appealed to their native justice\\r\\nand magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our\\r\\ncommon kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably\\r\\ninterrupt our connections and correspondence.  They too have been\\r\\ndeaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity.  We must, therefore,\\r\\nacquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them,\\r\\nas we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America,\\r\\nin General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of\\r\\nthe world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name,\\r\\nand by the Authority of the good People of these Colonies,\\r\\nsolemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are,\\r\\nand of Right ought to be Free and Independent States;\\r\\nthat they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown,\\r\\nand that all political connection between them and the State\\r\\nof Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved;\\r\\nand that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to\\r\\nlevy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce,\\r\\nand to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may\\r\\nof right do.  And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm\\r\\nreliance on the Protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge\\r\\nto each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDecember, 1972  [Etext #2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n****The Project Gutenberg Etext of The U.

This much we pledge. . .and more.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share:\\r\\nwe pledge the loyalty of faithful friends.  United. . .there is\\r\\nlittle we cannot do in a host of co-operative ventures.\\r\\nDivided. . .there is little we can do. . .for we dare not meet\\r\\na powerful challenge, at odds, and split asunder.\\r\\nTo those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free:\\r\\nwe pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not\\r\\nhave passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny.\\r\\nWe shall not always expect to find them supporting our view.\\r\\nBut we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their\\r\\nown freedom. . .and to remember that. . .in the past. . .those who\\r\\nfoolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside.\\r\\nTo those people in the huts and villages of half the globe\\r\\nstruggling to break the bonds of mass misery:  we pledge our best\\r\\nefforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period\\r\\nis required. . .not because the Communists may be doing it,\\r\\nnot because we seek their votes, but because it is right.\\r\\nIf a free society cannot help the many who are poor,\\r\\nit cannot save the few who are rich.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo our sister republics south of our border:  we offer a special pledge. . .\\r\\nto convert our good words into good deeds. . .in a new alliance for progress\\r\\n. . .to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of\\r\\npoverty.

For only when our arms are sufficient\\r\\nbeyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.\\r\\nBut neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from\\r\\nour present course. . .both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons,\\r\\nboth rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing\\r\\nto alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of Mankind\\'s\\r\\nfinal war.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo let us begin anew. . .remembering on both sides that civility\\r\\nis not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof.\\r\\nLet us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.\\r\\nLet both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring\\r\\nthose problems which divide us.  Let both sides, for the first time,\\r\\nformulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and\\r\\ncontrol of arms. . .and bring the absolute power to destroy\\r\\nother nations under the absolute control of all nations.\\r\\nLet both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead\\r\\nof its terrors.

Now the trumpet summons us again. . .\\r\\nnot as a call to bear arms, though arms we need. . .not as a call to battle. . .\\r\\nthough embattled we are. . .but a call to bear the burden of a long\\r\\ntwilight struggle. . .year in and year out, rejoicing in hope,\\r\\npatient in tribulation. . .a struggle against the common enemies of man:\\r\\ntyranny. . .poverty. . .disease. . .and war itself.  Can we forge against\\r\\nthese enemies a grand and global alliance. . .North and South. . .\\r\\nEast and West. . .that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind?\\r\\nWill you join in that historic effort?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted\\r\\nthe role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger; I do not shrink\\r\\nfrom this responsibility. . .I welcome it.  I do not believe that any of us\\r\\nwould exchange places with any other people or any other generation.\\r\\nThe energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor\\r\\nwill light our country and all who serve it. . .and the glow from\\r\\nthat fire can truly light the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so, my fellow Americans. . .ask not what your country can\\r\\ndo for you. . .ask what you can do for your country.  My fellow\\r\\ncitizens of the world. . .ask not what America will do for you,\\r\\nbut what together we can do for the Freedom of Man.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world,\\r\\nask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice\\r\\nwhich we ask of you.  With a good conscience our only sure reward,\\r\\nwith history the final judge of our deeds; let us go forth to lead\\r\\nthe land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that\\r\\nhere on earth God\\'s work must truly be our own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDecember, 1974  [Etext #4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n**The Project Gutenberg Etext of Lincoln\\'s Gettysburg Address**\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a retranscription of one of the first Project\\r\\nGutenberg Etexts, offically dated December 31, 1974--\\r\\nand now officially re-released on November 19, 1993--\\r\\n130 years after it was spoken.

[Which was the Virgina Provincial\\r\\nConvention, March 23, 1775]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGive Me Liberty Or Give Me Death\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPatrick Henry, March 23, 1775.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo man thinks more highly than I do of the patriotism, as well as abilities,\\r\\nof the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the House.  But different\\r\\nmen often see the same subject in different lights; and, therefore, I hope it\\r\\nwill not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as I do\\r\\nopinions of a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my\\r\\nsentiments freely and without reserve.  This is no time for ceremony.\\r\\nThe questing before the House is one of awful moment to this country.\\r\\nFor my own part, I consider it as nothing less than a question of\\r\\nfreedom or slavery; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject\\r\\nought to be the freedom of the debate.  It is only in this way that\\r\\nwe can hope to arrive at truth, and fulfill the great responsibility\\r\\nwhich we hold to God and our country.  Should I keep back my opinions\\r\\nat such a time, through fear of giving offense, I should consider myself\\r\\nas guilty of treason towards my country, and of an act of disloyalty\\r\\ntoward the Majesty of Heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope.\\r\\nWe are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the\\r\\nsong of that siren till she transforms us into beasts.  Is this the part\\r\\nof wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty?\\r\\nAre we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not,\\r\\nand, having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their\\r\\ntemporal salvation?  For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost,\\r\\nI am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of\\r\\nexperience.  I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past.\\r\\nAnd judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct\\r\\nof the British ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with\\r\\nwhich  gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the House.\\r\\nIs it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received?\\r\\nTrust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to your feet.  Suffer not yourselves\\r\\nto be betrayed with a kiss.  Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our\\r\\npetition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters and\\r\\ndarken our land.  Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and\\r\\nreconciliation?  Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that\\r\\nforce must be called in to win back our love?  Let us not deceive ourselves,\\r\\nsir.  These are the implements of war and subjugation; the last arguments to\\r\\nwhich kings resort.  I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if\\r\\nits purpose be not to force us to submission?  Can gentlemen assign any other\\r\\npossible motive for it?  Has Great Britain any enemy, in this quarter of\\r\\nthe world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies?  No, sir,\\r\\nshe has none.  They are meant for us:  they can be meant for no other.\\r\\nThey are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the British\\r\\nministry have been so long forging.  And what have we to oppose to them?\\r\\nShall we try argument?  Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years.\\r\\nHave we anything new to offer upon the subject?  Nothing.  We have held the\\r\\nsubject up in every light of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain.\\r\\nShall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication?  What terms shall we\\r\\nfind which have not been already exhausted?  Let us not, I beseech you, sir,\\r\\ndeceive ourselves.  Sir, we have done everything that could be done to avert\\r\\nthe storm which is now coming on.  We have petitioned; we have remonstrated;\\r\\nwe have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have\\r\\nimplored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and\\r\\nParliament.  Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced\\r\\nadditional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded;\\r\\nand we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne!\\r\\nIn vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and\\r\\nreconciliation.  There is no longer any room for hope.  If we wish to be free--\\r\\nif we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which\\r\\nwe have been so long contending--if we mean not basely to abandon the noble\\r\\nstruggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged\\r\\nourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest\\r\\nshall be obtained--we must fight!  I repeat it, sir, we must fight!\\r\\nAn appeal to arms  and to the God of hosts is all that is left us!\\r\\n\\r\\nThey tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable\\r\\nan adversary.  But when shall we be stronger?  Will it be the next week,\\r\\nor the next year?  Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British\\r\\nguard shall be stationed in every house?  Shall we gather strength but\\r\\nirresolution and inaction?  Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance\\r\\nby lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until\\r\\nour enemies shall have bound us hand and foot?  Sir, we are not weak if we make\\r\\na proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power.\\r\\nThe millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a\\r\\ncountry as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy\\r\\ncan send against us.  Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone.\\r\\nThere is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will\\r\\nraise up friends to fight our battles for us.  The battle, sir, is not to the\\r\\nstrong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave.  Besides, sir,\\r\\nwe have no election.  If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late\\r\\nto retire from the contest.  There is no retreat but in submission and slavery!\\r\\nOur chains are forged!  Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston!\\r\\nThe war is inevitable--and let it come!  I repeat it, sir, let it come.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter.  Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace--\\r\\nbut there is no peace.  The war is actually begun!  The next gale that sweeps\\r\\nfrom the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms!\\r\\nOur brethren are already in the field!  Why stand we here idle?\\r\\nWhat is it that gentlemen wish?  What would they have?  Is life so dear,\\r\\nor peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?\\r\\nForbid it, Almighty God!

Then a statement, somewhat\\r\\nin detail, of a course to be pursued, seemed fitting and proper.\\r\\nNow, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations\\r\\nhave been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great\\r\\ncontest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies\\r\\nof the nation, little that is new could be presented.  The progress\\r\\nof our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known\\r\\nto the public as to myself; and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory\\r\\nand encouraging to all.  With high hope for the future, no prediction\\r\\nin regard to it is ventured.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all thoughts\\r\\nwere anxiously directed to an impending civil war.  All dreaded it--\\r\\nall sought to avert it.  While the inaugural address was being delivered\\r\\nfrom this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war,\\r\\ninsurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war--\\r\\nseeking to dissolve the Union, and divide effects, by negotiation.\\r\\nBoth parties deprecated war; but one of them would make war rather\\r\\nthan let the nation survive; and the other would accept war rather\\r\\nthan let it perish.  And the war came.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed\\r\\ngenerally over the Union, but localized in the Southern part of it.\\r\\nThese slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest.  All knew\\r\\nthat this interest was, somehow, the cause of the war.  To strengthen,\\r\\nperpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the\\r\\ninsurgents would rend the Union, even by war; while the government claimed\\r\\nno right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration\\r\\nwhich it has already attained.  Neither anticipated that the cause\\r\\nof the conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict itself\\r\\nshould cease.  Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less\\r\\nfundamental and astounding.  Both read the same Bible, and pray\\r\\nto the same God; and each invokes his aid against the other.\\r\\nIt may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God\\'s\\r\\nassistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men\\'s faces;\\r\\nbut let us judge not, that we be not judged.  The prayers of both\\r\\ncould not be answered--that of neither has been answered fully.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Almighty has his own purposes.  \"Woe unto the world because\\r\\nof offenses! for it must needs be that offenses come; but woe\\r\\nto that man by whom the offense cometh.\"  If we shall suppose\\r\\nthat American slavery is one of those offenses which, in the\\r\\nprovidence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued\\r\\nthrough his appointed time, he now wills to remove, and that he\\r\\ngives to both North and South this terrible war, as the woe due\\r\\nto those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any\\r\\ndeparture from those divine attributes which the believers in a\\r\\nliving God always ascribe to him?  Fondly do we hope--fervently\\r\\ndo we pray--that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.\\r\\nYet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by\\r\\nthe bondsman\\'s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil\\r\\nshall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn by the lash\\r\\nshall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said\\r\\nthree thousand years ago, so still it must be said, \"The\\r\\njudgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in\\r\\nthe right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on\\r\\nto finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation\\'s wounds;\\r\\nto care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow,\\r\\nand his orphan--to do all which may achieve and cherish a just\\r\\nand lasting peace among ourselves, and with all nations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDecember, 1979  [Etext #9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Etext of Lincoln\\'s 1st Inaugural Address\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLincoln\\'s First Inaugural Address\\r\\nMarch 4, 1861\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFellow citizens of the United States:  in compliance with a custom as old\\r\\nas the government itself, I appear before you to address you briefly\\r\\nand to take, in your presence, the oath prescribed by the Constitution\\r\\nof the United States, to be taken by the President \"before he enters\\r\\non the execution of his office.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not consider it necessary, at present, for me to discuss those matters\\r\\nof administration about which there is no special anxiety, or excitement.\\r\\n\\r\\nApprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States\\r\\nthat by the accession of a Republican administration their property\\r\\nand their peace and personal security are to be endangered.\\r\\nThere has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension.\\r\\nIndeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while\\r\\nexisted and been open to their inspection.  It is found in\\r\\nnearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you.\\r\\nI do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that\\r\\n\"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with\\r\\nthe institution of slavery where it exists.  I believe I have\\r\\nno lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.\"\\r\\nThose who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge\\r\\nthat I had made this and many similar declarations, and had\\r\\nnever recanted them.  And, more than this, they placed in the\\r\\nplatform for my acceptance, and as a law to themselves and to me,\\r\\nthe clear and emphatic resolution which I now read:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Resolved:  that the maintenance inviolate\\r\\nof the rights of the States, and especially\\r\\nthe right of each State to order and control\\r\\nits own domestic institutions according to\\r\\nits own judgment exclusively, is essential\\r\\nto that balance of power on which the perfection\\r\\nand endurance of our political fabric depend,\\r\\nand we denounce the lawless invasion by armed\\r\\nforce of the soil of any State or Territory,\\r\\nno matter under what pretext,\\r\\nas among the gravest of crimes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI now reiterate these sentiments; and, in doing so, I only press upon\\r\\nthe public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case\\r\\nis susceptible, that the property, peace, and security of no section\\r\\nare to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration.\\r\\nI add, too, that all the protection which, consistently with the\\r\\nConstitution and the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully given\\r\\nto all the States when lawfully demanded, for whatever cause--\\r\\nas cheerfully to one section as to another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives\\r\\nfrom service or labor.  The clause I now read is as plainly\\r\\nwritten in the Constitution as any other of its provisions:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No person held to service or labor in one State,\\r\\nunder the laws thereof, escaping into another,\\r\\nshall in consequence of any law or regulation\\r\\ntherein be discharged from such service or labor,\\r\\nbut shall be delivered up on claim of the party\\r\\nto whom such service or labor may be due.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those\\r\\nwho made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves;\\r\\nand the intention of the lawgiver is the law.  All members\\r\\nof Congress swear their support to the whole Constitution--\\r\\nto this provision as much as to any other.  To the proposition,\\r\\nthen, that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause\\r\\n\"shall be delivered up\", their oaths are unanimous.  Now, if they\\r\\nwould make the effort in good temper, could they not with nearly\\r\\nequal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good\\r\\nthat unanimous oath?\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is some difference of opinion whether this clause should\\r\\nbe enforced by national or by State authority; but surely that\\r\\ndifference is not a very material one.  If the slave is to be\\r\\nsurrendered, it can be of but little consequence to him or to others\\r\\nby which authority it is done.  And should any one in any case be\\r\\ncontent that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial\\r\\ncontroversy as to HOW it shall be kept?\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the safeguards of\\r\\nliberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced,\\r\\nso that a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as a slave?\\r\\nAnd might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the\\r\\nenforcement of that clause in the Constitution which guarantees that\\r\\n\"the citizen of each State shall be entitled to all privileged and\\r\\nimmunities of citizens in the several States?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI take the official oath today with no mental reservations,\\r\\nand with no purpose to construe the Constitution or laws by\\r\\nany hypercritical rules.  And while I do not choose now to specify\\r\\nparticular acts of Congress as proper to be enforced, I do suggest\\r\\nthat it will be much safer for all, both in official and private stations,\\r\\nto conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed,\\r\\nthan to violate any of them, trusting to find impunity in having\\r\\nthem held to be unConstitutional.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President\\r\\nunder our national Constitution.  During that period fifteen different\\r\\nand greatly distinguished citizens have, in succession, administered\\r\\nthe executive branch of the government.  They have conducted it through\\r\\nmany perils, and generally with great success.  Yet, with all this scope\\r\\nof precedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief Constitutional\\r\\nterm of four years under great and peculiar difficulty.  A disruption of\\r\\nthe Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hold that, in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution,\\r\\nthe Union of these States is perpetual.  Perpetuity is implied,\\r\\nif not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments.\\r\\nIt is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision\\r\\nin its organic law for its own termination.  Continue to execute all\\r\\nthe express provisions of our National Constitution, and the Union will\\r\\nendure forever--it being impossible to destroy it except by some action\\r\\nnot provided for in the instrument itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, if the United States be not a government proper, but an association\\r\\nof States in the nature of contract merely, can it, as a contract,\\r\\nbe peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it?\\r\\nOne party to a contract may violate it--break it, so to speak;\\r\\nbut does it not require all to lawfully rescind it?\\r\\n\\r\\nDescending from these general principles, we find the proposition\\r\\nthat in legal contemplation the Union is perpetual confirmed by\\r\\nthe history of the Union itself.  The Union is much older than\\r\\nthe Constitution.  It was formed, in fact, by the Articles of\\r\\nAssociation in 1774.  It was matured and continued by the\\r\\nDeclaration of Independence in 1776.  It was further matured,\\r\\nand the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted\\r\\nand engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation\\r\\nin 1778.  And, finally, in 1787 one of the declared objects for ordaining\\r\\nand establishing the Constitution was \"TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if the destruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the States\\r\\nbe lawfully possible, the Union is LESS perfect than before the Constitution,\\r\\nhaving lost the vital element of perpetuity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motion\\r\\ncan lawfully get out of the Union; that Resolves and Ordinances\\r\\nto that effect are legally void; and that acts of violence,\\r\\nwithin any State or States, against the authority of the United States,\\r\\nare insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nI therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws,\\r\\nthe Union is unbroken; and to the extent of my ability I shall take care,\\r\\nas the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the\\r\\nlaws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States.\\r\\nDoing this I deem to be only a simple duty on my part;\\r\\nand I shall perform it so far as practicable, unless my\\r\\nrightful masters, the American people, shall withhold the\\r\\nrequisite means, or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary.\\r\\nI trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the\\r\\ndeclared purpose of the Union that it WILL Constitutionally\\r\\ndefend and maintain itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence; and there\\r\\nshall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority.\\r\\nThe power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess\\r\\nthe property and places belonging to the government, and to collect\\r\\nthe duties and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects,\\r\\nthere will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people\\r\\nanywhere.  Where hostility to the United States, in any interior locality,\\r\\nshall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens\\r\\nfrom holding the Federal offices, there will be no attempt to force\\r\\nobnoxious strangers among the people for that object.  While the strict\\r\\nlegal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of\\r\\nthese offices, the attempt to do so would be so irritating,\\r\\nand so nearly impracticable withal, that I deem it better\\r\\nto forego for the time the uses of such offices.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts\\r\\nof the Union.  So far as possible, the people everywhere shall have that\\r\\nsense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought\\r\\nand reflection.  The course here indicated will be followed unless current\\r\\nevents and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper,\\r\\nand in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised\\r\\naccording to circumstances actually existing, and with a view and\\r\\na hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the\\r\\nrestoration of fraternal sympathies and affections.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy\\r\\nthe Union at all events, and are glad of any pretext to do it, I will\\r\\nneither affirm nor deny; but if there be such, I need address no word\\r\\nto them.  To those, however, who really love the Union may I not speak?\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our\\r\\nnational fabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes,\\r\\nwould it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it?\\r\\nWill you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility\\r\\nthat any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence?\\r\\nWill you, while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all\\r\\nthe real ones you fly from--will you risk the commission of so\\r\\nfearful a mistake?\\r\\n\\r\\nAll profess to be content in the Union if all Constitutional rights\\r\\ncan be maintained.  Is it true, then, that any right, plainly written\\r\\nin the Constitution, has been denied?  I think not.  Happily the human\\r\\nmind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this.\\r\\nThink, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written provision\\r\\nof the Constitution has ever been denied.  If by the mere force of numbers a\\r\\nmajority should deprive a minority of any clearly written Constitutional right,\\r\\nit might, in a moral point of view, justify revolution--certainly would if such\\r\\na right were a vital one.  But such is not our case.  All the vital rights of\\r\\nminorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations\\r\\nand negations, guaranties and prohibitions, in the Constitution, that\\r\\ncontroversies never arise concerning them.  But no organic law can ever be\\r\\nframed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may\\r\\noccur in practical administration.  No foresight can anticipate,\\r\\nnor any document of reasonable length contain, express provisions\\r\\nfor all possible questions.  Shall fugitives from labor be surrendered\\r\\nby national or State authority?  The Constitution does not expressly say.\\r\\nMay Congress prohibit slavery in the Territories?  The Constitution does not\\r\\nexpressly say.  MUST Congress protect slavery in the Territories?\\r\\nThe Constitution does not expressly say.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies,\\r\\nand we divide upon them into majorities and minorities.  If the minority\\r\\nwill not acquiesce, the majority must, or the government must cease.\\r\\nThere is no other alternative; for continuing the government is\\r\\nacquiescence on one side or the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce,\\r\\nthey make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them;\\r\\nfor a minority of their own will secede from them whenever\\r\\na majority refuses to be controlled by such minority.\\r\\nFor instance, why may not any portion of a new\\r\\nconfederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again,\\r\\nprecisely as portions of the present Union now claim to secede from it?\\r\\nAll who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the\\r\\nexact temper of doing this.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs there such perfect identity of interests among the States\\r\\nto compose a new Union, as to produce harmony only,\\r\\nand prevent renewed secession?\\r\\n\\r\\nPlainly, the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy.\\r\\nA majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations,\\r\\nand always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular\\r\\nopinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.\\r\\nWhoever rejects it does, of necessity, fly to anarchy or to despotism.\\r\\nUnanimity is impossible; the rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement,\\r\\nis wholly inadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority principle,\\r\\nanarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not forget the position, assumed by some, that Constitutional\\r\\nquestions are to be decided by the Supreme Court; nor do I deny\\r\\nthat such decisions must be binding, in any case, upon the parties\\r\\nto a suit, as to the object of that suit, while they are also entitled\\r\\nto very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other\\r\\ndepartments of the government.  And while it is obviously possible that\\r\\nsuch decision may be erroneous in any given case, still the evil effect\\r\\nfollowing it, being limited to that particular case, with the chance that\\r\\nit may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases,\\r\\ncan better be borne than could the evils of a different practice.\\r\\nAt the same time, the candid citizen must confess that if the policy\\r\\nof the government, upon vital questions affecting the whole people,\\r\\nis to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court,\\r\\nthe instant they are made, in ordinary litigation between parties\\r\\nin personal actions, the people will have ceased to be their own rulers,\\r\\nhaving to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands\\r\\nof that eminent tribunal.  Nor is there in this view any assault upon\\r\\nthe court or the judges.  It is a duty from which they may not shrink\\r\\nto decide cases properly brought before them, and it is no fault of\\r\\ntheirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne section of our country believes slavery is RIGHT, and ought\\r\\nto be extended, while the other believes it is WRONG, and ought\\r\\nnot to be extended.  This is the only substantial dispute.\\r\\nThe fugitive-slave clause of the Constitution, and the law for the\\r\\nsuppression of the foreign slave-trade, are each as well enforced,\\r\\nperhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral\\r\\nsense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself.\\r\\nThe great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation\\r\\nin both cases, and a few break over in each.  This, I think,\\r\\ncannot be perfectly cured; and it would be worse in both cases\\r\\nAFTER the separation of the sections than BEFORE.  The foreign\\r\\nslave-trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived,\\r\\nwithout restriction, in one section, while fugitive slaves,\\r\\nnow only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered\\r\\nat all by the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhysically speaking, we cannot separate.  We cannot remove our\\r\\nrespective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall\\r\\nbetween them.  A husband and wife may be divorced, and go out of\\r\\nthe presence and beyond the reach of each other; but the different\\r\\nparts of our country cannot do this.  They cannot but remain\\r\\nface to face, and intercourse, either amicable or hostile,\\r\\nmust continue between them.  Is it possible, then, to make\\r\\nthat intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after\\r\\nseparation than before?  Can aliens make treaties easier than\\r\\nfriends can make laws?  Can treaties be more faithfully enforced\\r\\nbetween aliens than laws can among friends?  Suppose you go to war,\\r\\nyou cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides,\\r\\nan no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions\\r\\nas to terms of intercourse are again upon you.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it.\\r\\nWhenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can exercise\\r\\ntheir CONSTITUTIONAL right of amending it, or their REVOLUTIONARY right\\r\\nto dismember or overthrow it.  I cannot be ignorant of the fact\\r\\nthat many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the\\r\\nnational Constitution amended.  While I make no recommendation of\\r\\namendments, I fully recognize the rightful authority of the people\\r\\nover the whole subject, to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed\\r\\nin the instrument itself; and I should, under existing circumstances,\\r\\nfavor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people\\r\\nto act upon it.  I will venture to add that to me the convention mode\\r\\nseems preferable, in that it allows amendments to originate with\\r\\nthe people themselves, instead of only permitting them to take or\\r\\nreject propositions originated by others not especially chosen\\r\\nfor the purpose, and which might not be precisely such as they would\\r\\nwish to either accept or refuse.  I understand a proposed amendment\\r\\nto the Constitution--which amendment, however, I have not seen--has\\r\\npassed Congress, to the effect that the Federal Government shall\\r\\nnever interfere with the domestic institutions of the States,\\r\\nincluding that of persons held to service.  To avoid misconstruction\\r\\nof what I have said, I depart from my purpose not to speak of particular\\r\\namendments so far as to say that, holding such a provision to now be\\r\\nimplied Constitutional law, I have no objection to its being made express\\r\\nand irrevocable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people,\\r\\nand they have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the\\r\\nseparation of the states.  The people themselves can do this\\r\\nalso if they choose; but the executive, as such, has nothing to\\r\\ndo with it.  His duty is to administer the present government,\\r\\nas it came to his hands, and to transmit it, unimpaired by him,\\r\\nto his successor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice\\r\\nof the people?  Is there any better or equal hope in the world?\\r\\nIn our present differences is either party without faith of being\\r\\nin the right?  If the Almighty Ruler of Nations, with his eternal\\r\\ntruth and justice, be on your side of the North, or on yours\\r\\nof the South, that truth and that justice will surely prevail,\\r\\nby the judgment of this great tribunal, the American people.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the frame of the government under which we live, this same people\\r\\nhave wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief;\\r\\nand have, with equal wisdom, provided for the return of that little\\r\\nto their own hands at very short intervals.  While the people retain\\r\\ntheir virtue and vigilance, no administration, by any extreme of\\r\\nwickedness or folly, can very seriously injure the government\\r\\nin the short space of four years.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy countrymen, one and all, think calmly and WELL upon this\\r\\nwhole subject.  Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time.\\r\\nIf there be an object to HURRY any of you in hot haste to a step\\r\\nwhich you would never take DELIBERATELY, that object will be\\r\\nfrustrated by taking time; but no good object can be frustrated\\r\\nby it.  Such of you as are now dissatisfied, still have the\\r\\nold Constitution unimpaired, and, on the sensitive point,\\r\\nthe laws of your own framing under it; while the new administration\\r\\nwill have no immediate power, if it would, to change either.\\r\\nIf it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the\\r\\nright side in the dispute, there still is no single good reason\\r\\nfor precipitate action.  Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity,\\r\\nand a firm reliance on him who has never yet forsaken this favored land,\\r\\nare still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn YOUR hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in MINE,\\r\\nis the momentous issue of civil war.  The government will not assail YOU.\\r\\nYou can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors.\\r\\nYOU have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government, while _I_\\r\\nshall have the most solemn one to \"preserve, protect, and defend it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI am loathe to close.  We are not enemies, but friends.  We must not\\r\\nbe enemies.  Though passion may have strained, it must not break\\r\\nour bonds of affection.  The mystic chords of memory, stretching from\\r\\nevery battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone\\r\\nall over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union\\r\\nwhen again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\\r\\n\\r\\n***End of the Collected Etexts of Project Gutenberg of the 1970\\'s***\\r\\n**We hope to rely on your continued support until the end of 2001,**\\r\\nwhen we hope to have presented the 10,000th Project Gutenberg Etext!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n===============\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Declaration of Independence\\r\\n\\r\\nCopyright laws are changing all over the world.

The title was stored\\r\\nin an emailed instruction set which required a tape or diskpack be\\r\\nhand mounted for retrieval.  The diskpack was the size of a large\\r\\ncake in a cake carrier, cost $1500, and contained 5 megabytes, of\\r\\nwhich this file took 1-2%.  Two tape backups were kept plus one on\\r\\npaper tape.  The 10,000 files we hope to have online by the end of\\r\\n2001 should take about 1-2% of a comparably priced drive in 2001.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis file was never copyrighted, Sharewared, etc., and is thus for\\r\\nall to use and copy in any manner they choose.  Please feel free to\\r\\nmake your own edition using this as a base.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my research for creating this transcription of our first Etext,\\r\\nI have come across enough discrepancies [even within that official\\r\\ndocumentation provided by the United States] to conclude that even\\r\\n\"facsimiles\" of the Declaration of Indendence will NOT going to be\\r\\nall the same as the original, nor of other \"facsimiles.\"  There is\\r\\na plethora of variations in capitalization, punctuation, and, even\\r\\nwhere names appear on the documents [which names I have left out].\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resulting document has several misspellings removed from those\\r\\nparchment \"facsimiles\" I used back in 1971, and which I should not\\r\\nbe able to easily find at this time, including \"Brittain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[JT, Apr 05: \"Brittish\", however, is spelled as in the original.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n**The Project Gutenberg Etext of The Declaration of Independence**\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Declaration of Independence of The United States of America\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIN CONGRESS, July 4, 1776\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for\\r\\none people to dissolve the political bands which have connected\\r\\nthem with another, and to assume, among the Powers of the earth,\\r\\nthe separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and\\r\\nof Nature\\'s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions\\r\\nof mankind requires that they should declare the causes which\\r\\nimpel them to the separation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,\\r\\nthat they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,\\r\\nthat among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\\r\\nThat to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men,\\r\\nderiving their just powers from the consent of the governed,\\r\\nThat whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends,\\r\\nit is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute\\r\\nnew Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing\\r\\nits powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect\\r\\ntheir Safety and Happiness.  Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments\\r\\nlong established should not be changed for light and transient causes;\\r\\nand accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed\\r\\nto suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing\\r\\nthe forms to which they are accustomed.  But when a long train of abuses and\\r\\nusurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce\\r\\nthem under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw\\r\\noff such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.\\r\\n--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now\\r\\nthe necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.\\r\\nThe history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated\\r\\ninjuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment\\r\\nof an absolute Tyranny over these States.  To prove this, let Facts\\r\\nbe submitted to a candid world.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary\\r\\nfor the public good.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate\\r\\nand pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation\\r\\ntill his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended,\\r\\nhe has utterly neglected to attend to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of\\r\\nlarge districts of people, unless those people would relinquish\\r\\nthe right of Representation in the Legislature, a right\\r\\ninestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,\\r\\nuncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their\\r\\nPublic Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them\\r\\ninto compliance with his measures.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing\\r\\nwith manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions,\\r\\nto cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative Powers,\\r\\nincapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large\\r\\nfor their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed\\r\\nto all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States;\\r\\nfor that purpose obstructing the Laws of Naturalization of Foreigners;\\r\\nrefusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither,\\r\\nand raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent\\r\\nto Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has made judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure\\r\\nof their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of\\r\\nOfficers to harass our People, and eat out their substance.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies\\r\\nwithout the Consent of our legislatures.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of\\r\\nand superior to the Civil Power.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction\\r\\nforeign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws;\\r\\ngiving his Assent to their Acts of pretended legislation:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murders\\r\\nwhich they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor imposing taxes on us without our Consent:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring\\r\\nProvince, establishing therein an Arbitrary government,\\r\\nand enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once\\r\\nan example and fit instrument for introducing the same\\r\\nabsolute rule into these Colonies:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws,\\r\\nand altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves\\r\\ninvested with Power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection\\r\\nand waging War against us.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns,\\r\\nand destroyed the lives of our people.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries\\r\\nto compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun\\r\\nwith circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the\\r\\nmost barbarous ages, and totally unworthy of the Head of a civilized nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas\\r\\nto bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of\\r\\ntheir friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has\\r\\nendeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers,\\r\\nthe merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare,\\r\\nis an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress\\r\\nin the most humble terms:  Our repeated Petitions have been answered\\r\\nonly by repeated injury.  A Prince, whose character is thus marked\\r\\nby every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler\\r\\nof a free People.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor have We been wanting in attention to our Brittish brethren.\\r\\nWe have warned them from time to time of attempts by their\\r\\nlegislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.\\r\\nWe have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and\\r\\nsettlement here.  We have appealed to their native justice\\r\\nand magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our\\r\\ncommon kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably\\r\\ninterrupt our connections and correspondence.  They too have been\\r\\ndeaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity.  We must, therefore,\\r\\nacquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them,\\r\\nas we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America,\\r\\nin General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of\\r\\nthe world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name,\\r\\nand by the Authority of the good People of these Colonies,\\r\\nsolemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are,\\r\\nand of Right ought to be Free and Independent States;\\r\\nthat they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown,\\r\\nand that all political connection between them and the State\\r\\nof Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved;\\r\\nand that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to\\r\\nlevy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce,\\r\\nand to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may\\r\\nof right do.  And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm\\r\\nreliance on the Protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge\\r\\nto each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Declaration of Independence\\r\\n\\r\\n******This file should be named when12.txt or when12.zip******\\r\\n\\r\\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, when13.txt\\r\\nVERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, when12a.txt\\r\\n\\r\\nThis etext was produced by Michael S.

       " 'Research has demonstrated that creatine supplementation has some therapeutic benefit with respect to muscle function and more recently neurological function. Despite the growing body of literature on the pharmacologic effect of creatine, very little is known about the disposition of creatine after supraphysiologic doses. The movement of creatine throughout the body is governed by transport processes which impact the absorption of creatine from the intestine, clearance of creatine from the kidney, and access of creatine to target tissues. With repeated doses of creatine, it appears that the clearance of creatine decreases mainly due to the saturation of skeletal muscle stores. Insulin and insulin-stimulating foods appear to enhance muscle uptake of creatine but at the same time, high carbohydrate meals may slow the absorption of creatine from the intestine. Little is known about creatine disposition in special populations including the elderly and patients with neuromuscular disease. Knowledge of creatine disposition in these clinically relevant populations can help remove some of the guess work of dose selection during clinical trials.')"
