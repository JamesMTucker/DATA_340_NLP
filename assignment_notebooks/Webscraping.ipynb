       "address than there was at the first.  Then a statement, somewhat\n",
       "in detail, of a course to be pursued, seemed fitting and proper.\n",
       "Now, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations\n",
       "have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great\n",
       "contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies\n",
       "of the nation, little that is new could be presented.  The progress\n",
       "of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known\n",
       "to the public as to myself; and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory\n",
       "and encouraging to all.  With high hope for the future, no prediction\n",

       "\n",
       "On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all thoughts\n",
       "were anxiously directed to an impending civil war.  All dreaded it--\n",
       "all sought to avert it.  While the inaugural address was being delivered\n",
       "from this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war,\n",
       "insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war--\n",
       "seeking to dissolve the Union, and divide effects, by negotiation.\n",
       "Both parties deprecated war; but one of them would make war rather\n",
       "than let the nation survive; and the other would accept war rather\n",
       "than let it perish.  And the war came.\n",
       "\n",
       "One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed\n",
       "generally over the Union, but localized in the Southern part of it.\n",
       "These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest.  All knew\n",
       "that this interest was, somehow, the cause of the war.  To strengthen,\n",
       "perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the\n",
       "insurgents would rend the Union, even by war; while the government claimed\n",
       "no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration\n",
       "which it has already attained.  Neither anticipated that the cause\n",
       "of the conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict itself\n",
       "should cease.  Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less\n",
       "fundamental and astounding.  Both read the same Bible, and pray\n",
       "to the same God; and each invokes his aid against the other.\n",
       "It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's\n",
       "assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces;\n",

       "to that man by whom the offense cometh.\"  If we shall suppose\n",
       "that American slavery is one of those offenses which, in the\n",
       "providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued\n",
       "through his appointed time, he now wills to remove, and that he\n",

       "as the government itself, I appear before you to address you briefly\n",
       "and to take, in your presence, the oath prescribed by the Constitution\n",
       "of the United States, to be taken by the President \"before he enters\n",

       "There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension.\n",
       "Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while\n",
       "existed and been open to their inspection.  It is found in\n",
       "nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you.\n",
       "I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that\n",
       "\"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with\n",
       "the institution of slavery where it exists.  I believe I have\n",
       "no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.\"\n",
       "Those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge\n",
       "that I had made this and many similar declarations, and had\n",
       "never recanted them.  And, more than this, they placed in the\n",
       "platform for my acceptance, and as a law to themselves and to me,\n",
       "the clear and emphatic resolution which I now read:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Resolved:  that the maintenance inviolate\n",
       "of the rights of the States, and especially\n",
       "the right of each State to order and control\n",
       "its own domestic institutions according to\n",
       "its own judgment exclusively, is essential\n",
       "to that balance of power on which the perfection\n",
       "and endurance of our political fabric depend,\n",
       "and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed\n",
       "force of the soil of any State or Territory,\n",
       "no matter under what pretext,\n",
       "as among the gravest of crimes.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "I now reiterate these sentiments; and, in doing so, I only press upon\n",
       "the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case\n",
       "is susceptible, that the property, peace, and security of no section\n",
       "are to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration.\n",
       "I add, too, that all the protection which, consistently with the\n",
       "Constitution and the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully given\n",
       "to all the States when lawfully demanded, for whatever cause--\n",
       "as cheerfully to one section as to another.\n",
       "\n",
       "There is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives\n",
       "from service or labor.  The clause I now read is as plainly\n",
       "written in the Constitution as any other of its provisions:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No person held to service or labor in one State,\n",
       "under the laws thereof, escaping into another,\n",
       "shall in consequence of any law or regulation\n",
       "therein be discharged from such service or labor,\n",
       "but shall be delivered up on claim of the party\n",
       "to whom such service or labor may be due.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those\n",
       "who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves;\n",
       "and the intention of the lawgiver is the law.  All members\n",
       "of Congress swear their support to the whole Constitution--\n",
       "to this provision as much as to any other.  To the proposition,\n",
       "then, that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause\n",
       "\"shall be delivered up\", their oaths are unanimous.  Now, if they\n",
       "would make the effort in good temper, could they not with nearly\n",
       "equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good\n",
       "that unanimous oath?\n",
       "\n",
       "There is some difference of opinion whether this clause should\n",
       "be enforced by national or by State authority; but surely that\n",
       "difference is not a very material one.  If the slave is to be\n",
       "surrendered, it can be of but little consequence to him or to others\n",
       "by which authority it is done.  And should any one in any case be\n",
       "content that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial\n",
       "controversy as to HOW it shall be kept?\n",
       "\n",
       "Again, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the safeguards of\n",
       "liberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced,\n",
       "so that a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as a slave?\n",
       "And might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the\n",
       "enforcement of that clause in the Constitution which guarantees that\n",
       "\"the citizen of each State shall be entitled to all privileged and\n",
       "immunities of citizens in the several States?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "I take the official oath today with no mental reservations,\n",
       "and with no purpose to construe the Constitution or laws by\n",
       "any hypercritical rules.  And while I do not choose now to specify\n",
       "particular acts of Congress as proper to be enforced, I do suggest\n",
       "that it will be much safer for all, both in official and private stations,\n",
       "to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed,\n",
       "than to violate any of them, trusting to find impunity in having\n",
       "them held to be unConstitutional.\n",
       "\n",
       "It is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President\n",
       "under our national Constitution.  During that period fifteen different\n",
       "and greatly distinguished citizens have, in succession, administered\n",
       "the executive branch of the government.  They have conducted it through\n",
       "many perils, and generally with great success.  Yet, with all this scope\n",
       "of precedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief Constitutional\n",
       "term of four years under great and peculiar difficulty.  A disruption of\n",
       "the Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted.\n",
       "\n",
       "I hold that, in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution,\n",
       "the Union of these States is perpetual.  Perpetuity is implied,\n",
       "if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments.\n",
       "It is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision\n",
       "in its organic law for its own termination.  Continue to execute all\n",
       "the express provisions of our National Constitution, and the Union will\n",
       "endure forever--it being impossible to destroy it except by some action\n",
       "not provided for in the instrument itself.\n",
       "\n",
       "Again, if the United States be not a government proper, but an association\n",
       "of States in the nature of contract merely, can it, as a contract,\n",
       "be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it?\n",
       "One party to a contract may violate it--break it, so to speak;\n",
       "but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it?\n",
       "\n",
       "Descending from these general principles, we find the proposition\n",
       "that in legal contemplation the Union is perpetual confirmed by\n",
       "the history of the Union itself.  The Union is much older than\n",
       "the Constitution.  It was formed, in fact, by the Articles of\n",
       "Association in 1774.  It was matured and continued by the\n",
       "Declaration of Independence in 1776.  It was further matured,\n",
       "and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted\n",
       "and engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation\n",
       "in 1778.  And, finally, in 1787 one of the declared objects for ordaining\n",
       "and establishing the Constitution was \"TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "But if the destruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the States\n",
       "be lawfully possible, the Union is LESS perfect than before the Constitution,\n",
       "having lost the vital element of perpetuity.\n",
       "\n",
       "It follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motion\n",
       "can lawfully get out of the Union; that Resolves and Ordinances\n",
       "to that effect are legally void; and that acts of violence,\n",
       "within any State or States, against the authority of the United States,\n",
       "are insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances.\n",
       "\n",
       "I therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws,\n",
       "the Union is unbroken; and to the extent of my ability I shall take care,\n",
       "as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the\n",
       "laws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States.\n",
       "Doing this I deem to be only a simple duty on my part;\n",
       "and I shall perform it so far as practicable, unless my\n",
       "rightful masters, the American people, shall withhold the\n",
       "requisite means, or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary.\n",
       "I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the\n",
       "declared purpose of the Union that it WILL Constitutionally\n",
       "defend and maintain itself.\n",
       "\n",
       "In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence; and there\n",
       "shall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority.\n",
       "The power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess\n",
       "the property and places belonging to the government, and to collect\n",
       "the duties and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects,\n",
       "there will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people\n",
       "anywhere.  Where hostility to the United States, in any interior locality,\n",
       "shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens\n",
       "from holding the Federal offices, there will be no attempt to force\n",
       "obnoxious strangers among the people for that object.  While the strict\n",
       "legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of\n",
       "these offices, the attempt to do so would be so irritating,\n",
       "and so nearly impracticable withal, that I deem it better\n",
       "to forego for the time the uses of such offices.\n",
       "\n",
       "The mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts\n",
       "of the Union.  So far as possible, the people everywhere shall have that\n",
       "sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought\n",
       "and reflection.  The course here indicated will be followed unless current\n",
       "events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper,\n",
       "and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised\n",
       "according to circumstances actually existing, and with a view and\n",
       "a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the\n",
       "restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections.\n",
       "\n",
       "That there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy\n",
       "the Union at all events, and are glad of any pretext to do it, I will\n",
       "neither affirm nor deny; but if there be such, I need address no word\n",
       "to them.  To those, however, who really love the Union may I not speak?\n",
       "\n",
       "Before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our\n",
       "national fabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes,\n",
       "would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it?\n",
       "Will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility\n",
       "that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence?\n",
       "Will you, while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all\n",
       "the real ones you fly from--will you risk the commission of so\n",
       "fearful a mistake?\n",
       "\n",
       "All profess to be content in the Union if all Constitutional rights\n",
       "can be maintained.  Is it true, then, that any right, plainly written\n",
       "in the Constitution, has been denied?  I think not.  Happily the human\n",
       "mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this.\n",

       "minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations\n",

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments\\r\\nlong established should not be changed for light and transient causes;\\r\\nand accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed\\r\\nto suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing\\r\\nthe forms to which they are accustomed.  But when a long train of abuses and\\r\\nusurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce\\r\\nthem under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw\\r\\noff such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.\\r\\n--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now\\r\\nthe necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.\\r\\nThe history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated\\r\\ninjuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment\\r\\nof an absolute Tyranny over these States.  To prove this, let Facts\\r\\nbe submitted to a candid world.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary\\r\\nfor the public good.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate\\r\\nand pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation\\r\\ntill his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended,\\r\\nhe has utterly neglected to attend to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of\\r\\nlarge districts of people, unless those people would relinquish\\r\\nthe right of Representation in the Legislature, a right\\r\\ninestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,\\r\\nuncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their\\r\\nPublic Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them\\r\\ninto compliance with his measures.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing\\r\\nwith manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions,\\r\\nto cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative Powers,\\r\\nincapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large\\r\\nfor their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed\\r\\nto all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States;\\r\\nfor that purpose obstructing the Laws of Naturalization of Foreigners;\\r\\nrefusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither,\\r\\nand raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent\\r\\nto Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has made judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure\\r\\nof their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of\\r\\nOfficers to harass our People, and eat out their substance.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies\\r\\nwithout the Consent of our legislatures.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of\\r\\nand superior to the Civil Power.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction\\r\\nforeign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws;\\r\\ngiving his Assent to their Acts of pretended legislation:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murders\\r\\nwhich they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor imposing taxes on us without our Consent:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring\\r\\nProvince, establishing therein an Arbitrary government,\\r\\nand enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once\\r\\nan example and fit instrument for introducing the same\\r\\nabsolute rule into these Colonies:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws,\\r\\nand altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves\\r\\ninvested with Power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection\\r\\nand waging War against us.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns,\\r\\nand destroyed the lives of our people.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries\\r\\nto compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun\\r\\nwith circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the\\r\\nmost barbarous ages, and totally unworthy of the Head of a civilized nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas\\r\\nto bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of\\r\\ntheir friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has\\r\\nendeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers,\\r\\nthe merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare,\\r\\nis an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress\\r\\nin the most humble terms:  Our repeated Petitions have been answered\\r\\nonly by repeated injury.  A Prince, whose character is thus marked\\r\\nby every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler\\r\\nof a free People.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor have We been wanting in attention to our British brethren.\\r\\nWe have warned them from time to time of attempts by their\\r\\nlegislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.\\r\\nWe have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and\\r\\nsettlement here.  We have appealed to their native justice\\r\\nand magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our\\r\\ncommon kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably\\r\\ninterrupt our connections and correspondence.  They too have been\\r\\ndeaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity.  We must, therefore,\\r\\nacquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them,\\r\\nas we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America,\\r\\nin General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of\\r\\nthe world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name,\\r\\nand by the Authority of the good People of these Colonies,\\r\\nsolemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are,\\r\\nand of Right ought to be Free and Independent States;\\r\\nthat they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown,\\r\\nand that all political connection between them and the State\\r\\nof Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved;\\r\\nand that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to\\r\\nlevy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce,\\r\\nand to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may\\r\\nof right do.  And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm\\r\\nreliance on the Protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge\\r\\nto each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDecember, 1972  ',\n",

This much we pledge. . .and more.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share:\\r\\nwe pledge the loyalty of faithful friends.  United. . .there is\\r\\nlittle we cannot do in a host of co-operative ventures.\\r\\nDivided. . .there is little we can do. . .for we dare not meet\\r\\na powerful challenge, at odds, and split asunder.\\r\\nTo those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free:\\r\\nwe pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not\\r\\nhave passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny.\\r\\nWe shall not always expect to find them supporting our view.\\r\\nBut we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their\\r\\nown freedom. . .and to remember that. . .in the past. . .those who\\r\\nfoolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside.\\r\\nTo those people in the huts and villages of half the globe\\r\\nstruggling to break the bonds of mass misery:  we pledge our best\\r\\nefforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period\\r\\nis required. . .not because the Communists may be doing it,\\r\\nnot because we seek their votes, but because it is right.\\r\\nIf a free society cannot help the many who are poor,\\r\\nit cannot save the few who are rich.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo our sister republics south of our border:  we offer a special pledge. . .\\r\\nto convert our good words into good deeds. . .in a new alliance for progress\\r\\n. . .to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of\\r\\npoverty.  But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of\\r\\nhostile powers.  Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them\\r\\nto oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas. . .and let\\r\\nevery other power know that this hemisphere intends to remain the master\\r\\nof its own house.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo that world assembly of sovereign states:  the United Nations. . .\\r\\nour last best hope in an age where the instruments of war\\r\\nhave far outpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our pledge\\r\\nof support. . .to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for\\r\\ninvective. . .to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak. . .\\r\\nand to enlarge the area in which its writ may run.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversaries,\\r\\nwe offer not a pledge but a request:  that both sides begin anew\\r\\nthe quest for peace; before the dark powers of destruction unleashed\\r\\nby science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction.\\r\\nWe dare not tempt them with weakness.  For only when our arms are sufficient\\r\\nbeyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.\\r\\nBut neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from\\r\\nour present course. . .both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons,\\r\\nboth rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing\\r\\nto alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of Mankind\\'s\\r\\nfinal war.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo let us begin anew. . .remembering on both sides that civility\\r\\nis not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof.\\r\\nLet us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.\\r\\nLet both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring\\r\\nthose problems which divide us.  Let both sides, for the first time,\\r\\nformulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and\\r\\ncontrol of arms. . .and bring the absolute power to destroy\\r\\nother nations under the absolute control of all nations.\\r\\nLet both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead\\r\\nof its terrors.  Together let us explore the stars, conquer the\\r\\ndeserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, and encourage\\r\\nthe arts and commerce.  Let both sides unite to heed in all corners\\r\\nof the earth the command of Isaiah. . .to \"undo the heavy burdens. . .\\r\\nlet the oppressed go free.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if a beachhead of co-operation may push back the jungle of suspicion. . .\\r\\nlet both sides join in creating not a new balance of power. . .\\r\\nbut a new world of law. . .where the strong are just. . .\\r\\nand the weak secure. . .and the peace preserved. . . .\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this will not be finished in the first one hundred days.\\r\\nNor will it be finished in the first one thousand days. . .\\r\\nnor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps\\r\\nin our lifetime on this planet.

Since this country was founded,\\r\\neach generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony\\r\\nto its national loyalty.  The graves of young Americans who answered\\r\\nthe call to service surround the globe.  Now the trumpet summons us again. . .\\r\\nnot as a call to bear arms, though arms we need. . .not as a call to battle. . .\\r\\nthough embattled we are. . .but a call to bear the burden of a long\\r\\ntwilight struggle. . .year in and year out, rejoicing in hope,\\r\\npatient in tribulation. . .a struggle against the common enemies of man:\\r\\ntyranny. . .poverty. . .disease. . .and war itself.  Can we forge against\\r\\nthese enemies a grand and global alliance. . .North and South. . .\\r\\nEast and West. . .that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind?\\r\\nWill you join in that historic effort?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted\\r\\nthe role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger; I do not shrink\\r\\nfrom this responsibility. . .I welcome it.  I do not believe that any of us\\r\\nwould exchange places with any other people or any other generation.\\r\\nThe energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor\\r\\nwill light our country and all who serve it. . .and the glow from\\r\\nthat fire can truly light the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so, my fellow Americans. . .ask not what your country can\\r\\ndo for you. . .ask what you can do for your country.  My fellow\\r\\ncitizens of the world. . .ask not what America will do for you,\\r\\nbut what together we can do for the Freedom of Man.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world,\\r\\nask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice\\r\\nwhich we ask of you.  With a good conscience our only sure reward,\\r\\nwith history the final judge of our deeds; let us go forth to lead\\r\\nthe land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that\\r\\nhere on earth God\\'s work must truly be our own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDecember, 1974  ',\n",

[Which was the Virgina Provincial\\r\\nConvention, March 23, 1775]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGive Me Liberty Or Give Me Death\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPatrick Henry, March 23, 1775.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo man thinks more highly than I do of the patriotism, as well as abilities,\\r\\nof the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the House.  But different\\r\\nmen often see the same subject in different lights; and, therefore, I hope it\\r\\nwill not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as I do\\r\\nopinions of a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my\\r\\nsentiments freely and without reserve.  This is no time for ceremony.\\r\\nThe questing before the House is one of awful moment to this country.\\r\\nFor my own part, I consider it as nothing less than a question of\\r\\nfreedom or slavery; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject\\r\\nought to be the freedom of the debate.  It is only in this way that\\r\\nwe can hope to arrive at truth, and fulfill the great responsibility\\r\\nwhich we hold to God and our country.  Should I keep back my opinions\\r\\nat such a time, through fear of giving offense, I should consider myself\\r\\nas guilty of treason towards my country, and of an act of disloyalty\\r\\ntoward the Majesty of Heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope.\\r\\nWe are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the\\r\\nsong of that siren till she transforms us into beasts.  Is this the part\\r\\nof wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty?\\r\\nAre we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not,\\r\\nand, having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their\\r\\ntemporal salvation?  For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost,\\r\\nI am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of\\r\\nexperience.  I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past.\\r\\nAnd judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct\\r\\nof the British ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with\\r\\nwhich  gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the House.\\r\\nIs it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received?\\r\\nTrust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to your feet.  Suffer not yourselves\\r\\nto be betrayed with a kiss.  Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our\\r\\npetition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters and\\r\\ndarken our land.  Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and\\r\\nreconciliation?  Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that\\r\\nforce must be called in to win back our love?  Let us not deceive ourselves,\\r\\nsir.  These are the implements of war and subjugation; the last arguments to\\r\\nwhich kings resort.  I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if\\r\\nits purpose be not to force us to submission?  Can gentlemen assign any other\\r\\npossible motive for it?  Has Great Britain any enemy, in this quarter of\\r\\nthe world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies?  No, sir,\\r\\nshe has none.  They are meant for us:  they can be meant for no other.\\r\\nThey are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the British\\r\\nministry have been so long forging.  And what have we to oppose to them?\\r\\nShall we try argument?  Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years.\\r\\nHave we anything new to offer upon the subject?  Nothing.  We have held the\\r\\nsubject up in every light of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain.\\r\\nShall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication?  What terms shall we\\r\\nfind which have not been already exhausted?  Let us not, I beseech you, sir,\\r\\ndeceive ourselves.  Sir, we have done everything that could be done to avert\\r\\nthe storm which is now coming on.  We have petitioned; we have remonstrated;\\r\\nwe have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have\\r\\nimplored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and\\r\\nParliament.  Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced\\r\\nadditional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded;\\r\\nand we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne!\\r\\nIn vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and\\r\\nreconciliation.  There is no longer any room for hope.  If we wish to be free--\\r\\nif we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which\\r\\nwe have been so long contending--if we mean not basely to abandon the noble\\r\\nstruggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged\\r\\nourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest\\r\\nshall be obtained--we must fight!  I repeat it, sir, we must fight!\\r\\nAn appeal to arms  and to the God of hosts is all that is left us!\\r\\n\\r\\nThey tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable\\r\\nan adversary.  But when shall we be stronger?  Will it be the next week,\\r\\nor the next year?  Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British\\r\\nguard shall be stationed in every house?  Shall we gather strength but\\r\\nirresolution and inaction?  Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance\\r\\nby lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until\\r\\nour enemies shall have bound us hand and foot?  Sir, we are not weak if we make\\r\\na proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power.\\r\\nThe millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a\\r\\ncountry as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy\\r\\ncan send against us.  Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone.\\r\\nThere is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will\\r\\nraise up friends to fight our battles for us.  The battle, sir, is not to the\\r\\nstrong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave.  Besides, sir,\\r\\nwe have no election.  If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late\\r\\nto retire from the contest.  There is no retreat but in submission and slavery!\\r\\nOur chains are forged!  Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston!\\r\\nThe war is inevitable--and let it come!  I repeat it, sir, let it come.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter.  Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace--\\r\\nbut there is no peace.  The war is actually begun!  The next gale that sweeps\\r\\nfrom the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms!\\r\\nOur brethren are already in the field!  Why stand we here idle?\\r\\nWhat is it that gentlemen wish?  What would they have?  Is life so dear,\\r\\nor peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?\\r\\nForbid it, Almighty God!  I know not what course others may take;\\r\\nbut as for me, give me liberty or give me death!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficially released December 31, 1977  ',\n",

Then a statement, somewhat\\r\\nin detail, of a course to be pursued, seemed fitting and proper.\\r\\nNow, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations\\r\\nhave been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great\\r\\ncontest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies\\r\\nof the nation, little that is new could be presented.  The progress\\r\\nof our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known\\r\\nto the public as to myself; and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory\\r\\nand encouraging to all.  With high hope for the future, no prediction\\r\\nin regard to it is ventured.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all thoughts\\r\\nwere anxiously directed to an impending civil war.  All dreaded it--\\r\\nall sought to avert it.  While the inaugural address was being delivered\\r\\nfrom this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war,\\r\\ninsurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war--\\r\\nseeking to dissolve the Union, and divide effects, by negotiation.\\r\\nBoth parties deprecated war; but one of them would make war rather\\r\\nthan let the nation survive; and the other would accept war rather\\r\\nthan let it perish.  And the war came.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed\\r\\ngenerally over the Union, but localized in the Southern part of it.\\r\\nThese slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest.  All knew\\r\\nthat this interest was, somehow, the cause of the war.  To strengthen,\\r\\nperpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the\\r\\ninsurgents would rend the Union, even by war; while the government claimed\\r\\nno right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration\\r\\nwhich it has already attained.  Neither anticipated that the cause\\r\\nof the conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict itself\\r\\nshould cease.  Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less\\r\\nfundamental and astounding.  Both read the same Bible, and pray\\r\\nto the same God; and each invokes his aid against the other.\\r\\nIt may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God\\'s\\r\\nassistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men\\'s faces;\\r\\nbut let us judge not, that we be not judged.  The prayers of both\\r\\ncould not be answered--that of neither has been answered fully.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Almighty has his own purposes.  \"Woe unto the world because\\r\\nof offenses! for it must needs be that offenses come; but woe\\r\\nto that man by whom the offense cometh.\"  If we shall suppose\\r\\nthat American slavery is one of those offenses which, in the\\r\\nprovidence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued\\r\\nthrough his appointed time, he now wills to remove, and that he\\r\\ngives to both North and South this terrible war, as the woe due\\r\\nto those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any\\r\\ndeparture from those divine attributes which the believers in a\\r\\nliving God always ascribe to him?  Fondly do we hope--fervently\\r\\ndo we pray--that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.\\r\\nYet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by\\r\\nthe bondsman\\'s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil\\r\\nshall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn by the lash\\r\\nshall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said\\r\\nthree thousand years ago, so still it must be said, \"The\\r\\njudgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in\\r\\nthe right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on\\r\\nto finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation\\'s wounds;\\r\\nto care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow,\\r\\nand his orphan--to do all which may achieve and cherish a just\\r\\nand lasting peace among ourselves, and with all nations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDecember, 1979  ',\n",
       " '\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Etext of Lincoln\\'s 1st Inaugural Address\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLincoln\\'s First Inaugural Address\\r\\nMarch 4, 1861\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFellow citizens of the United States:  in compliance with a custom as old\\r\\nas the government itself, I appear before you to address you briefly\\r\\nand to take, in your presence, the oath prescribed by the Constitution\\r\\nof the United States, to be taken by the President \"before he enters\\r\\non the execution of his office.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not consider it necessary, at present, for me to discuss those matters\\r\\nof administration about which there is no special anxiety, or excitement.\\r\\n\\r\\nApprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States\\r\\nthat by the accession of a Republican administration their property\\r\\nand their peace and personal security are to be endangered.\\r\\nThere has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension.\\r\\nIndeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while\\r\\nexisted and been open to their inspection.  It is found in\\r\\nnearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you.\\r\\nI do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that\\r\\n\"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with\\r\\nthe institution of slavery where it exists.  I believe I have\\r\\nno lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.\"\\r\\nThose who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge\\r\\nthat I had made this and many similar declarations, and had\\r\\nnever recanted them.  And, more than this, they placed in the\\r\\nplatform for my acceptance, and as a law to themselves and to me,\\r\\nthe clear and emphatic resolution which I now read:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Resolved:  that the maintenance inviolate\\r\\nof the rights of the States, and especially\\r\\nthe right of each State to order and control\\r\\nits own domestic institutions according to\\r\\nits own judgment exclusively, is essential\\r\\nto that balance of power on which the perfection\\r\\nand endurance of our political fabric depend,\\r\\nand we denounce the lawless invasion by armed\\r\\nforce of the soil of any State or Territory,\\r\\nno matter under what pretext,\\r\\nas among the gravest of crimes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI now reiterate these sentiments; and, in doing so, I only press upon\\r\\nthe public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case\\r\\nis susceptible, that the property, peace, and security of no section\\r\\nare to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration.\\r\\nI add, too, that all the protection which, consistently with the\\r\\nConstitution and the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully given\\r\\nto all the States when lawfully demanded, for whatever cause--\\r\\nas cheerfully to one section as to another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives\\r\\nfrom service or labor.  The clause I now read is as plainly\\r\\nwritten in the Constitution as any other of its provisions:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No person held to service or labor in one State,\\r\\nunder the laws thereof, escaping into another,\\r\\nshall in consequence of any law or regulation\\r\\ntherein be discharged from such service or labor,\\r\\nbut shall be delivered up on claim of the party\\r\\nto whom such service or labor may be due.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those\\r\\nwho made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves;\\r\\nand the intention of the lawgiver is the law.  All members\\r\\nof Congress swear their support to the whole Constitution--\\r\\nto this provision as much as to any other.  To the proposition,\\r\\nthen, that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause\\r\\n\"shall be delivered up\", their oaths are unanimous.  Now, if they\\r\\nwould make the effort in good temper, could they not with nearly\\r\\nequal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good\\r\\nthat unanimous oath?\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is some difference of opinion whether this clause should\\r\\nbe enforced by national or by State authority; but surely that\\r\\ndifference is not a very material one.  If the slave is to be\\r\\nsurrendered, it can be of but little consequence to him or to others\\r\\nby which authority it is done.  And should any one in any case be\\r\\ncontent that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial\\r\\ncontroversy as to HOW it shall be kept?\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the safeguards of\\r\\nliberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced,\\r\\nso that a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as a slave?\\r\\nAnd might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the\\r\\nenforcement of that clause in the Constitution which guarantees that\\r\\n\"the citizen of each State shall be entitled to all privileged and\\r\\nimmunities of citizens in the several States?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI take the official oath today with no mental reservations,\\r\\nand with no purpose to construe the Constitution or laws by\\r\\nany hypercritical rules.  And while I do not choose now to specify\\r\\nparticular acts of Congress as proper to be enforced, I do suggest\\r\\nthat it will be much safer for all, both in official and private stations,\\r\\nto conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed,\\r\\nthan to violate any of them, trusting to find impunity in having\\r\\nthem held to be unConstitutional.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President\\r\\nunder our national Constitution.  During that period fifteen different\\r\\nand greatly distinguished citizens have, in succession, administered\\r\\nthe executive branch of the government.  They have conducted it through\\r\\nmany perils, and generally with great success.  Yet, with all this scope\\r\\nof precedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief Constitutional\\r\\nterm of four years under great and peculiar difficulty.  A disruption of\\r\\nthe Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hold that, in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution,\\r\\nthe Union of these States is perpetual.  Perpetuity is implied,\\r\\nif not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments.\\r\\nIt is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision\\r\\nin its organic law for its own termination.  Continue to execute all\\r\\nthe express provisions of our National Constitution, and the Union will\\r\\nendure forever--it being impossible to destroy it except by some action\\r\\nnot provided for in the instrument itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, if the United States be not a government proper, but an association\\r\\nof States in the nature of contract merely, can it, as a contract,\\r\\nbe peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it?\\r\\nOne party to a contract may violate it--break it, so to speak;\\r\\nbut does it not require all to lawfully rescind it?\\r\\n\\r\\nDescending from these general principles, we find the proposition\\r\\nthat in legal contemplation the Union is perpetual confirmed by\\r\\nthe history of the Union itself.  The Union is much older than\\r\\nthe Constitution.  It was formed, in fact, by the Articles of\\r\\nAssociation in 1774.  It was matured and continued by the\\r\\nDeclaration of Independence in 1776.  It was further matured,\\r\\nand the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted\\r\\nand engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation\\r\\nin 1778.  And, finally, in 1787 one of the declared objects for ordaining\\r\\nand establishing the Constitution was \"TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if the destruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the States\\r\\nbe lawfully possible, the Union is LESS perfect than before the Constitution,\\r\\nhaving lost the vital element of perpetuity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motion\\r\\ncan lawfully get out of the Union; that Resolves and Ordinances\\r\\nto that effect are legally void; and that acts of violence,\\r\\nwithin any State or States, against the authority of the United States,\\r\\nare insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nI therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws,\\r\\nthe Union is unbroken; and to the extent of my ability I shall take care,\\r\\nas the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the\\r\\nlaws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States.\\r\\nDoing this I deem to be only a simple duty on my part;\\r\\nand I shall perform it so far as practicable, unless my\\r\\nrightful masters, the American people, shall withhold the\\r\\nrequisite means, or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary.\\r\\nI trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the\\r\\ndeclared purpose of the Union that it WILL Constitutionally\\r\\ndefend and maintain itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence; and there\\r\\nshall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority.\\r\\nThe power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess\\r\\nthe property and places belonging to the government, and to collect\\r\\nthe duties and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects,\\r\\nthere will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people\\r\\nanywhere.  Where hostility to the United States, in any interior locality,\\r\\nshall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens\\r\\nfrom holding the Federal offices, there will be no attempt to force\\r\\nobnoxious strangers among the people for that object.  While the strict\\r\\nlegal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of\\r\\nthese offices, the attempt to do so would be so irritating,\\r\\nand so nearly impracticable withal, that I deem it better\\r\\nto forego for the time the uses of such offices.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts\\r\\nof the Union.  So far as possible, the people everywhere shall have that\\r\\nsense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought\\r\\nand reflection.  The course here indicated will be followed unless current\\r\\nevents and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper,\\r\\nand in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised\\r\\naccording to circumstances actually existing, and with a view and\\r\\na hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the\\r\\nrestoration of fraternal sympathies and affections.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy\\r\\nthe Union at all events, and are glad of any pretext to do it, I will\\r\\nneither affirm nor deny; but if there be such, I need address no word\\r\\nto them.  To those, however, who really love the Union may I not speak?\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our\\r\\nnational fabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes,\\r\\nwould it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it?\\r\\nWill you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility\\r\\nthat any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence?\\r\\nWill you, while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all\\r\\nthe real ones you fly from--will you risk the commission of so\\r\\nfearful a mistake?\\r\\n\\r\\nAll profess to be content in the Union if all Constitutional rights\\r\\ncan be maintained.  Is it true, then, that any right, plainly written\\r\\nin the Constitution, has been denied?  I think not.  Happily the human\\r\\nmind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this.\\r\\nThink, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written provision\\r\\nof the Constitution has ever been denied.  If by the mere force of numbers a\\r\\nmajority should deprive a minority of any clearly written Constitutional right,\\r\\nit might, in a moral point of view, justify revolution--certainly would if such\\r\\na right were a vital one.  But such is not our case.  All the vital rights of\\r\\nminorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations\\r\\nand negations, guaranties and prohibitions, in the Constitution, that\\r\\ncontroversies never arise concerning them.  But no organic law can ever be\\r\\nframed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may\\r\\noccur in practical administration.  No foresight can anticipate,\\r\\nnor any document of reasonable length contain, express provisions\\r\\nfor all possible questions.  Shall fugitives from labor be surrendered\\r\\nby national or State authority?  The Constitution does not expressly say.\\r\\nMay Congress prohibit slavery in the Territories?  The Constitution does not\\r\\nexpressly say.  MUST Congress protect slavery in the Territories?\\r\\nThe Constitution does not expressly say.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies,\\r\\nand we divide upon them into majorities and minorities.  If the minority\\r\\nwill not acquiesce, the majority must, or the government must cease.\\r\\nThere is no other alternative; for continuing the government is\\r\\nacquiescence on one side or the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce,\\r\\nthey make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them;\\r\\nfor a minority of their own will secede from them whenever\\r\\na majority refuses to be controlled by such minority.\\r\\nFor instance, why may not any portion of a new\\r\\nconfederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again,\\r\\nprecisely as portions of the present Union now claim to secede from it?\\r\\nAll who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the\\r\\nexact temper of doing this.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs there such perfect identity of interests among the States\\r\\nto compose a new Union, as to produce harmony only,\\r\\nand prevent renewed secession?\\r\\n\\r\\nPlainly, the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy.\\r\\nA majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations,\\r\\nand always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular\\r\\nopinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.\\r\\nWhoever rejects it does, of necessity, fly to anarchy or to despotism.\\r\\nUnanimity is impossible; the rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement,\\r\\nis wholly inadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority principle,\\r\\nanarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not forget the position, assumed by some, that Constitutional\\r\\nquestions are to be decided by the Supreme Court; nor do I deny\\r\\nthat such decisions must be binding, in any case, upon the parties\\r\\nto a suit, as to the object of that suit, while they are also entitled\\r\\nto very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other\\r\\ndepartments of the government.  And while it is obviously possible that\\r\\nsuch decision may be erroneous in any given case, still the evil effect\\r\\nfollowing it, being limited to that particular case, with the chance that\\r\\nit may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases,\\r\\ncan better be borne than could the evils of a different practice.\\r\\nAt the same time, the candid citizen must confess that if the policy\\r\\nof the government, upon vital questions affecting the whole people,\\r\\nis to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court,\\r\\nthe instant they are made, in ordinary litigation between parties\\r\\nin personal actions, the people will have ceased to be their own rulers,\\r\\nhaving to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands\\r\\nof that eminent tribunal.  Nor is there in this view any assault upon\\r\\nthe court or the judges.  It is a duty from which they may not shrink\\r\\nto decide cases properly brought before them, and it is no fault of\\r\\ntheirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne section of our country believes slavery is RIGHT, and ought\\r\\nto be extended, while the other believes it is WRONG, and ought\\r\\nnot to be extended.  This is the only substantial dispute.\\r\\nThe fugitive-slave clause of the Constitution, and the law for the\\r\\nsuppression of the foreign slave-trade, are each as well enforced,\\r\\nperhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral\\r\\nsense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself.\\r\\nThe great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation\\r\\nin both cases, and a few break over in each.  This, I think,\\r\\ncannot be perfectly cured; and it would be worse in both cases\\r\\nAFTER the separation of the sections than BEFORE.  The foreign\\r\\nslave-trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived,\\r\\nwithout restriction, in one section, while fugitive slaves,\\r\\nnow only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered\\r\\nat all by the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhysically speaking, we cannot separate.  We cannot remove our\\r\\nrespective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall\\r\\nbetween them.  A husband and wife may be divorced, and go out of\\r\\nthe presence and beyond the reach of each other; but the different\\r\\nparts of our country cannot do this.  They cannot but remain\\r\\nface to face, and intercourse, either amicable or hostile,\\r\\nmust continue between them.  Is it possible, then, to make\\r\\nthat intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after\\r\\nseparation than before?  Can aliens make treaties easier than\\r\\nfriends can make laws?  Can treaties be more faithfully enforced\\r\\nbetween aliens than laws can among friends?  Suppose you go to war,\\r\\nyou cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides,\\r\\nan no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions\\r\\nas to terms of intercourse are again upon you.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it.\\r\\nWhenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can exercise\\r\\ntheir CONSTITUTIONAL right of amending it, or their REVOLUTIONARY right\\r\\nto dismember or overthrow it.  I cannot be ignorant of the fact\\r\\nthat many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the\\r\\nnational Constitution amended.  While I make no recommendation of\\r\\namendments, I fully recognize the rightful authority of the people\\r\\nover the whole subject, to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed\\r\\nin the instrument itself; and I should, under existing circumstances,\\r\\nfavor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people\\r\\nto act upon it.  I will venture to add that to me the convention mode\\r\\nseems preferable, in that it allows amendments to originate with\\r\\nthe people themselves, instead of only permitting them to take or\\r\\nreject propositions originated by others not especially chosen\\r\\nfor the purpose, and which might not be precisely such as they would\\r\\nwish to either accept or refuse.  I understand a proposed amendment\\r\\nto the Constitution--which amendment, however, I have not seen--has\\r\\npassed Congress, to the effect that the Federal Government shall\\r\\nnever interfere with the domestic institutions of the States,\\r\\nincluding that of persons held to service.  To avoid misconstruction\\r\\nof what I have said, I depart from my purpose not to speak of particular\\r\\namendments so far as to say that, holding such a provision to now be\\r\\nimplied Constitutional law, I have no objection to its being made express\\r\\nand irrevocable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people,\\r\\nand they have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the\\r\\nseparation of the states.  The people themselves can do this\\r\\nalso if they choose; but the executive, as such, has nothing to\\r\\ndo with it.  His duty is to administer the present government,\\r\\nas it came to his hands, and to transmit it, unimpaired by him,\\r\\nto his successor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice\\r\\nof the people?  Is there any better or equal hope in the world?\\r\\nIn our present differences is either party without faith of being\\r\\nin the right?  If the Almighty Ruler of Nations, with his eternal\\r\\ntruth and justice, be on your side of the North, or on yours\\r\\nof the South, that truth and that justice will surely prevail,\\r\\nby the judgment of this great tribunal, the American people.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the frame of the government under which we live, this same people\\r\\nhave wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief;\\r\\nand have, with equal wisdom, provided for the return of that little\\r\\nto their own hands at very short intervals.  While the people retain\\r\\ntheir virtue and vigilance, no administration, by any extreme of\\r\\nwickedness or folly, can very seriously injure the government\\r\\nin the short space of four years.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy countrymen, one and all, think calmly and WELL upon this\\r\\nwhole subject.  Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time.\\r\\nIf there be an object to HURRY any of you in hot haste to a step\\r\\nwhich you would never take DELIBERATELY, that object will be\\r\\nfrustrated by taking time; but no good object can be frustrated\\r\\nby it.  Such of you as are now dissatisfied, still have the\\r\\nold Constitution unimpaired, and, on the sensitive point,\\r\\nthe laws of your own framing under it; while the new administration\\r\\nwill have no immediate power, if it would, to change either.\\r\\nIf it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the\\r\\nright side in the dispute, there still is no single good reason\\r\\nfor precipitate action.  Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity,\\r\\nand a firm reliance on him who has never yet forsaken this favored land,\\r\\nare still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn YOUR hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in MINE,\\r\\nis the momentous issue of civil war.  The government will not assail YOU.\\r\\nYou can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors.\\r\\nYOU have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government, while _I_\\r\\nshall have the most solemn one to \"preserve, protect, and defend it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI am loathe to close.  We are not enemies, but friends.  We must not\\r\\nbe enemies.  Though passion may have strained, it must not break\\r\\nour bonds of affection.  The mystic chords of memory, stretching from\\r\\nevery battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone\\r\\nall over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union\\r\\nwhen again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\\r\\n\\r\\n']"

       "[\"THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume, among the Powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.  Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.  But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. --Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.  To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them. He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within. He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws of Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands. He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers. He has made judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our People, and eat out their substance. He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures. He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended legislation: For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us: For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States: For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world: For imposing taxes on us without our Consent: For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury: For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences: For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies: For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with Power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever. He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy of the Head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands. He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions. In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms:  Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury.  A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free People. Nor have We been wanting in attention to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here.  We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence.  They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity.  We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends. We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by the Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.  And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the Protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

       " 'We observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom. . . symbolizing an end as well as a beginning. . .signifying renewal as well as change for I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forbears prescribed nearly a century and three-quarters ago. The world is very different now, for man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life. And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forbears fought are still at issue around the globe. . .the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God. We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let the word go forth from this time and place. . .to friend and foe alike. . . that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans. . . born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage. . .and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today. . .at home and around the world. Let every nation know. . .whether it wishes us well or ill. . . that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and the success of liberty.  This much we pledge. . .and more. To those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share: we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends.  United. . .there is little we cannot do in a host of co-operative ventures. Divided. . .there is little we can do. . .for we dare not meet a powerful challenge, at odds, and split asunder. To those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free: we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny. We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view. But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom. . .and to remember that. . .in the past. . .those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside. To those people in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery:  we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required. . .not because the Communists may be doing it, not because we seek their votes, but because it is right. If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich. To our sister republics south of our border:  we offer a special pledge. . . to convert our good words into good deeds. . .in a new alliance for progress . . .to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty.  But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of hostile powers.  Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas. . .and let every other power know that this hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house. To that world assembly of sovereign states:  the United Nations. . . our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our pledge of support. . .to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for invective. . .to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak. . . and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run. Finally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversaries, we offer not a pledge but a request:  that both sides begin anew the quest for peace; before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction. We dare not tempt them with weakness.  For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed. But neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course. . .both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of Mankind\\'s final war. So let us begin anew. . .remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate. Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us.  Let both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms. . .and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations. Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors.  Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, and encourage the arts and commerce.  Let both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth the command of Isaiah. . .to \"undo the heavy burdens. . . let the oppressed go free.\" And if a beachhead of co-operation may push back the jungle of suspicion. . . let both sides join in creating not a new balance of power. . . but a new world of law. . .where the strong are just. . . and the weak secure. . .and the peace preserved. . . . All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days. Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days. . . nor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet.  But let us begin. In your hands, my fellow citizens. . .more than mine. . .will rest the final success or failure of our course.  Since this country was founded, each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty.  The graves of young Americans who answered the call to service surround the globe.  Now the trumpet summons us again. . . not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need. . .not as a call to battle. . . though embattled we are. . .but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle. . .year in and year out, rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation. . .a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny. . .poverty. . .disease. . .and war itself.  Can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance. . .North and South. . . East and West. . .that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind? Will you join in that historic effort? In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger; I do not shrink from this responsibility. . .I welcome it.  I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it. . .and the glow from that fire can truly light the world. And so, my fellow Americans. . .ask not what your country can do for you. . .ask what you can do for your country.  My fellow citizens of the world. . .ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the Freedom of Man. Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you.  With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds; let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God\\'s work must truly be our own.

       " 'THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 1787 We the people of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. Article 1 Section 1.  All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives. Section 2.  The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and the electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislature. No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years a citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen. Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons.  The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by law Direct.  The number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at least one Representative; and until such enumeration shall be made, the State of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New York six, New Jersey four, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North Carolina five, South Carolina five, and Georgia three. When vacancies happen in the Representation from any State, the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill such Vacancies. The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment. Section 3.  The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, chosen by the legislature thereof, for six Years; and each Senator shall have one Vote. Immediately after they shall be assembled in Consequence of the first Election, they shall be divided as equally as may be into three Classes.  The Seats of the Senators of the first Class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second Year, of the second Class at the expiration of the fourth Year, and of the third Class at the expiration of the sixth Year, so that one third may be chosen every second Year; and if vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the recess of the Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments until the next meeting of the Legislature, which shall then fill such Vacancies. No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen. The Vice-President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided. The Senate shall choose their other Officers, and also a President pro tempore, in the Absence of the Vice-President, or when he shall exercise the Office of President of the United States. The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present. Judgment in cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States:  but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law. Section 4.  The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators. The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by law appoint a different Day. Section 5.  Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business; but a smaller Number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, and under such Penalties as each House may provide. Each house may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and, with the Concurrence of two-thirds, expel a Member. Each house shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy; and the Yeas and Nays of the Members of either House on any question shall, at the Desire of one fifth of those Present, be entered on the Journal.

Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that house shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a law.  But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by Yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively.  If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which case it shall not be a Law. Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.

ARTICLE 2 Section 1.  The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.  He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice President chosen for the same Term, be elected, as follows: Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress:  but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector. The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by Ballot for two Persons, of whom one at least shall not lie an Inhabitant of the same State with themselves.  And they shall make a List of all the Persons voted for, and of the Number of Votes for each; which List they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the Seat of the Government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate.  The President of the Senate shall, in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the Certificates, and the Votes shall then be counted. The Person having the greatest Number of Votes shall be the President, if such Number be a Majority of the whole Number of Electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have such Majority, and have an equal Number of votes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately chuse by Ballot one of them for President; and if no Person have a Majority, then from the five highest on the List the said House shall in like Manner chuse the President.  But in chusing the President, the Votes shall be taken by States, the Representation from each State having one Vote; a Quorum for this Purpose shall consist of a Member or Members from two thirds of the States, and a Majority of all the States shall be necessary to a Choice.  In every Case, after the Choice of the President, the Person having the greatest Number of Votes of the Electors shall be the Vice President.  But if there should remain two or more who have equal Votes, the Senate shall chuse from them by Ballot the Vice President. The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States. No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States. In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by Law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a President shall be elected. The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be encreased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them. Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:--\"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" Section 2.  The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of impeachment.

The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next session. Section 3.  He shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient; he may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper; he shall receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers; he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, and shall Commission all the Officers of the United States.

Section 2.  The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;--to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls;--to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction;--to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party;--to Controversies between two or more States;--between a State and Citizens of another State;--between Citizens of different States; --between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects. In all cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction.  In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make. The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed. Section 3.  Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.  No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court. The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of Treason, but no Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood, or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attainted. ARTICLE FOUR Section 1.  Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records, and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof. Section 2.

No person held to Service or Labor in one State, under the Laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein, be discharged from such Service or Labor, But shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labor may be due. Section 3.  New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no new States shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or Parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress. The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United States, or of any particular State. Section 4.  The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence. ARTICLE FIVE The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of it\\'s equal Suffrage in the Senate.

       " 'No man thinks more highly than I do of the patriotism, as well as abilities, of the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the House.  But different men often see the same subject in different lights; and, therefore, I hope it will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as I do opinions of a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve.  This is no time for ceremony. The questing before the House is one of awful moment to this country. For my own part, I consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate.  It is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth, and fulfill the great responsibility which we hold to God and our country.  Should I keep back my opinions at such a time, through fear of giving offense, I should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my country, and of an act of disloyalty toward the Majesty of Heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings. Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts.  Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty? Are we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not, and, having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation?  For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it. I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of experience.  I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past. And judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the British ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with which  gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the House. Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received? Trust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to your feet.  Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss.  Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters and darken our land.  Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation?  Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love?  Let us not deceive ourselves, sir.  These are the implements of war and subjugation; the last arguments to which kings resort.  I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if its purpose be not to force us to submission?  Can gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it?  Has Great Britain any enemy, in this quarter of the world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies?  No, sir, she has none.  They are meant for us:  they can be meant for no other. They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the British ministry have been so long forging.  And what have we to oppose to them? Shall we try argument?  Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years. Have we anything new to offer upon the subject?  Nothing.  We have held the subject up in every light of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain. Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication?  What terms shall we find which have not been already exhausted?  Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves.  Sir, we have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on.  We have petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament.  Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne! In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation.  There is no longer any room for hope.  If we wish to be free-- if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contending--if we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained--we must fight!  I repeat it, sir, we must fight! An appeal to arms  and to the God of hosts is all that is left us! They tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable an adversary.  But when shall we be stronger?  Will it be the next week, or the next year?  Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed in every house?  Shall we gather strength but irresolution and inaction?  Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot?  Sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power. The millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us.  Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us.  The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave.  Besides, sir, we have no election.  If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest.  There is no retreat but in submission and slavery! Our chains are forged!  Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston! The war is inevitable--and let it come!  I repeat it, sir, let it come. It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter.  Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace-- but there is no peace.  The war is actually begun!  The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field!  Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish?  What would they have?  Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God!  I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death! Officially released December 31, 1977',\n",

       " 'Fellow countrymen:  At this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office, there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first.  Then a statement, somewhat in detail, of a course to be pursued, seemed fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new could be presented.  The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known to the public as to myself; and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all.  With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured. On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war.  All dreaded it-- all sought to avert it.  While the inaugural address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war-- seeking to dissolve the Union, and divide effects, by negotiation. Both parties deprecated war; but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive; and the other would accept war rather than let it perish.  And the war came. One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the Southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest.  All knew that this interest was, somehow, the cause of the war.  To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union, even by war; while the government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained.  Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict itself should cease.  Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding.  Both read the same Bible, and pray to the same God; and each invokes his aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God\\'s assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men\\'s faces; but let us judge not, that we be not judged.  The prayers of both could not be answered--that of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has his own purposes.  \"Woe unto the world because of offenses! for it must needs be that offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh.\"  If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through his appointed time, he now wills to remove, and that he gives to both North and South this terrible war, as the woe due to those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to him?  Fondly do we hope--fervently do we pray--that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman\\'s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn by the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said, \"The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.\" With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation\\'s wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan--to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves, and with all nations.

       " 'Fellow citizens of the United States:  in compliance with a custom as old as the government itself, I appear before you to address you briefly and to take, in your presence, the oath prescribed by the Constitution of the United States, to be taken by the President \"before he enters on the execution of his office.\" I do not consider it necessary, at present, for me to discuss those matters of administration about which there is no special anxiety, or excitement. Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that by the accession of a Republican administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered. There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection.  It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that \"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery where it exists.  I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.\" Those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that I had made this and many similar declarations, and had never recanted them.  And, more than this, they placed in the platform for my acceptance, and as a law to themselves and to me, the clear and emphatic resolution which I now read: \"Resolved:  that the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the States, and especially the right of each State to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively, is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend, and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any State or Territory, no matter under what pretext, as among the gravest of crimes.\" I now reiterate these sentiments; and, in doing so, I only press upon the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is susceptible, that the property, peace, and security of no section are to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration. I add, too, that all the protection which, consistently with the Constitution and the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully given to all the States when lawfully demanded, for whatever cause-- as cheerfully to one section as to another. There is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from service or labor.  The clause I now read is as plainly written in the Constitution as any other of its provisions: \"No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.\" It is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves; and the intention of the lawgiver is the law.  All members of Congress swear their support to the whole Constitution-- to this provision as much as to any other.  To the proposition, then, that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause \"shall be delivered up\", their oaths are unanimous.  Now, if they would make the effort in good temper, could they not with nearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good that unanimous oath? There is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforced by national or by State authority; but surely that difference is not a very material one.  If the slave is to be surrendered, it can be of but little consequence to him or to others by which authority it is done.  And should any one in any case be content that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to HOW it shall be kept? Again, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the safeguards of liberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced, so that a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as a slave? And might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of that clause in the Constitution which guarantees that \"the citizen of each State shall be entitled to all privileged and immunities of citizens in the several States?\" I take the official oath today with no mental reservations, and with no purpose to construe the Constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules.  And while I do not choose now to specify particular acts of Congress as proper to be enforced, I do suggest that it will be much safer for all, both in official and private stations, to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed, than to violate any of them, trusting to find impunity in having them held to be unConstitutional. It is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President under our national Constitution.  During that period fifteen different and greatly distinguished citizens have, in succession, administered the executive branch of the government.  They have conducted it through many perils, and generally with great success.  Yet, with all this scope of precedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief Constitutional term of four years under great and peculiar difficulty.  A disruption of the Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted. I hold that, in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution, the Union of these States is perpetual.  Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments. It is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination.  Continue to execute all the express provisions of our National Constitution, and the Union will endure forever--it being impossible to destroy it except by some action not provided for in the instrument itself. Again, if the United States be not a government proper, but an association of States in the nature of contract merely, can it, as a contract, be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it? One party to a contract may violate it--break it, so to speak; but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it? Descending from these general principles, we find the proposition that in legal contemplation the Union is perpetual confirmed by the history of the Union itself.  The Union is much older than the Constitution.  It was formed, in fact, by the Articles of Association in 1774.  It was matured and continued by the Declaration of Independence in 1776.  It was further matured, and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation in 1778.  And, finally, in 1787 one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the Constitution was \"TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION.\" But if the destruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the States be lawfully possible, the Union is LESS perfect than before the Constitution, having lost the vital element of perpetuity. It follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the Union; that Resolves and Ordinances to that effect are legally void; and that acts of violence, within any State or States, against the authority of the United States, are insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances. I therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws, the Union is unbroken; and to the extent of my ability I shall take care, as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the laws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States. Doing this I deem to be only a simple duty on my part; and I shall perform it so far as practicable, unless my rightful masters, the American people, shall withhold the requisite means, or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary. I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the declared purpose of the Union that it WILL Constitutionally defend and maintain itself. In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence; and there shall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority. The power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the property and places belonging to the government, and to collect the duties and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects, there will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people anywhere.  Where hostility to the United States, in any interior locality, shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the Federal offices, there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object.  While the strict legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of these offices, the attempt to do so would be so irritating, and so nearly impracticable withal, that I deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices. The mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts of the Union.  So far as possible, the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and reflection.  The course here indicated will be followed unless current events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper, and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised according to circumstances actually existing, and with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections. That there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the Union at all events, and are glad of any pretext to do it, I will neither affirm nor deny; but if there be such, I need address no word to them.  To those, however, who really love the Union may I not speak? Before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes, would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it? Will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence? Will you, while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly from--will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake? All profess to be content in the Union if all Constitutional rights can be maintained.  Is it true, then, that any right, plainly written in the Constitution, has been denied?  I think not.  Happily the human mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this. Think, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of the Constitution has ever been denied.  If by the mere force of numbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written Constitutional right, it might, in a moral point of view, justify revolution--certainly would if such a right were a vital one.  But such is not our case.  All the vital rights of minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations and negations, guaranties and prohibitions, in the Constitution, that controversies never arise concerning them.  But no organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical administration.  No foresight can anticipate, nor any document of reasonable length contain, express provisions for all possible questions.  Shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by national or State authority?  The Constitution does not expressly say. May Congress prohibit slavery in the Territories?  The Constitution does not expressly say.  MUST Congress protect slavery in the Territories? The Constitution does not expressly say. From questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies, and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities.  If the minority will not acquiesce, the majority must, or the government must cease. There is no other alternative; for continuing the government is acquiescence on one side or the other. If a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce, they make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them; for a minority of their own will secede from them whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such minority. For instance, why may not any portion of a new confederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again, precisely as portions of the present Union now claim to secede from it? All who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the exact temper of doing this. Is there such perfect identity of interests among the States to compose a new Union, as to produce harmony only, and prevent renewed secession? Plainly, the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy. A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people. Whoever rejects it does, of necessity, fly to anarchy or to despotism. Unanimity is impossible; the rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement, is wholly inadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority principle, anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left. I do not forget the position, assumed by some, that Constitutional questions are to be decided by the Supreme Court; nor do I deny that such decisions must be binding, in any case, upon the parties to a suit, as to the object of that suit, while they are also entitled to very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other departments of the government.  And while it is obviously possible that such decision may be erroneous in any given case, still the evil effect following it, being limited to that particular case, with the chance that it may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases, can better be borne than could the evils of a different practice. At the same time, the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government, upon vital questions affecting the whole people, is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made, in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions, the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal.  Nor is there in this view any assault upon the court or the judges.  It is a duty from which they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought before them, and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes. One section of our country believes slavery is RIGHT, and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is WRONG, and ought not to be extended.  This is the only substantial dispute. The fugitive-slave clause of the Constitution, and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave-trade, are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself. The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each.  This, I think, cannot be perfectly cured; and it would be worse in both cases AFTER the separation of the sections than BEFORE.  The foreign slave-trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived, without restriction, in one section, while fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the other. Physically speaking, we cannot separate.  We cannot remove our respective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall between them.  A husband and wife may be divorced, and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other; but the different parts of our country cannot do this.  They cannot but remain face to face, and intercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between them.  Is it possible, then, to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before?  Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws?  Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends?  Suppose you go to war, you cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides, an no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you. This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can exercise their CONSTITUTIONAL right of amending it, or their REVOLUTIONARY right to dismember or overthrow it.  I cannot be ignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the national Constitution amended.  While I make no recommendation of amendments, I fully recognize the rightful authority of the people over the whole subject, to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed in the instrument itself; and I should, under existing circumstances, favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people to act upon it.  I will venture to add that to me the convention mode seems preferable, in that it allows amendments to originate with the people themselves, instead of only permitting them to take or reject propositions originated by others not especially chosen for the purpose, and which might not be precisely such as they would wish to either accept or refuse.  I understand a proposed amendment to the Constitution--which amendment, however, I have not seen--has passed Congress, to the effect that the Federal Government shall never interfere with the domestic institutions of the States, including that of persons held to service.  To avoid misconstruction of what I have said, I depart from my purpose not to speak of particular amendments so far as to say that, holding such a provision to now be implied Constitutional law, I have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable. The chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people, and they have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of the states.  The people themselves can do this also if they choose; but the executive, as such, has nothing to do with it.  His duty is to administer the present government, as it came to his hands, and to transmit it, unimpaired by him, to his successor. Why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people?  Is there any better or equal hope in the world? In our present differences is either party without faith of being in the right?  If the Almighty Ruler of Nations, with his eternal truth and justice, be on your side of the North, or on yours of the South, that truth and that justice will surely prevail, by the judgment of this great tribunal, the American people. By the frame of the government under which we live, this same people have wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief; and have, with equal wisdom, provided for the return of that little to their own hands at very short intervals.  While the people retain their virtue and vigilance, no administration, by any extreme of wickedness or folly, can very seriously injure the government in the short space of four years. My countrymen, one and all, think calmly and WELL upon this whole subject.  Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time. If there be an object to HURRY any of you in hot haste to a step which you would never take DELIBERATELY, that object will be frustrated by taking time; but no good object can be frustrated by it.  Such of you as are now dissatisfied, still have the old Constitution unimpaired, and, on the sensitive point, the laws of your own framing under it; while the new administration will have no immediate power, if it would, to change either. If it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the right side in the dispute, there still is no single good reason for precipitate action.  Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity, and a firm reliance on him who has never yet forsaken this favored land, are still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty. In YOUR hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in MINE, is the momentous issue of civil war.  The government will not assail YOU. You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors. YOU have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government, while _I_ shall have the most solemn one to \"preserve, protect, and defend it.\" I am loathe to close.  We are not enemies, but friends.  We must not be enemies.  Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.  The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.']"
