## Project Structure

0. Abstract: This section provides a brief summary of the project, highlighting the main research question, methodology, results, and conclusions. It should be concise and clear, usually limited to 250-300 words.

1. Introduction: The introduction provides background information on the topic being studied, and explains the motivation behind the research question. This section also highlights the novelty of the research, its importance, and its potential impact. [NOTE: 1-2 paragraphs]

2. Literature review: This section provides a comprehensive review of the relevant literature on the topic being studied. It highlights the strengths and weaknesses of previous research and identifies gaps in the current understanding of the topic. [NOTE: Not required but will make an impression. 1-2 paragraphs]

3. Methodology/Dataset: This section explains the research design, including the data sources, data collection methods, and analysis techniques used. It also discusses any assumptions made and the rationale behind the chosen methods. [NOTE: 2-4 paragraphs]

4. Results: This section presents the findings of the research, including descriptive statistics, tables, and graphs. It should provide a clear and concise summary of the main results, highlighting any patterns or trends observed. [NOTE: 2-4 paragraphs]

5. Discussion: The discussion section interprets the results of the study in light of the research question and literature review. It should explain how the findings relate to previous research and provide a critical analysis of their implications. [NOTE: 6-10 paragraphs]

6. Conclusion: This section summarizes the main findings of the study, restates the research question, and discusses the implications of the research for future research and practice. [NOTE: 1-2 paragraphs]

7. References: This section provides a list of all the sources cited in the paper, following a specific citation style (e.g., APA, MLA).

8. Appendices: This section includes additional information that may be useful to readers, such as detailed descriptions of the data sources, mathematical derivations, or additional statistical analyses.

## Note on Reproducibility

The project should be reproducible. This means that the code should be available to the reader, and the results should be reproducible. This is important for two reasons:

1. It allows the reader to verify the results and conclusions of the study.

2. It allows the reader to extend the study and build on the results.
