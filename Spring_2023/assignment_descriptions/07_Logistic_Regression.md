# Logistic Regression model

## Due date

March 31, 2023

## Assignment description

Your task is to train two Logistic Regression models on the [IMDB Movie Review Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews). The first model will be trained on noun and adjective phrases and the second model will be trained on verbs and adverbs. You will then compare the performance of the two models, and reflect on the results of your analysis.

### Data

THe data is available on Kaggle. You can download the data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews). The data contain 25K positive reviews and 25K negative reviews.

### Objective

Classify the sentiment of a movie review using two different Logistic Regression models. You can use the [sklearn Logistic Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) model or the R equivalent. For creating your N-gram datasets, you can use the [CountVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) or the R equivalent and/or the [TfidfVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html) or the R equivalent. Consult the documentation for more information.

### Outcomes

The student will be able to:

* Think critically about feature engineering
* Train a Logistic regression model
* Evaluate the performance of a Logistic Regression model
* Compare the performance of different Logistic Regression models
* Explain the performance of a Logistic Regresion model
* Explain the limitations of a Logistic Regression model
