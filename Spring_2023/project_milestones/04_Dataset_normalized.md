# Dataset Creation

## Due date

March 10th, 2023

## Milestone description

Understanding your dataset is essential to accomplish good results in your final project. The old adage "garbage in, garbage out" is very true in data science and natural language processing. If you don't understand your dataset, you will not be able to create a good model. _Some_ of the questions you should ask yourself are:

### General Data Science Questions

* What is the size of the dataset?
* What are the data types of the variables?
* What are the descriptive statistics of the variables?
* Are there missing values?
* Are there outliers?
* Are there any correlations between the variables?
* Are there any patterns in the data?

### Specific Natural Language Processing Questions

* What is the size of the vocabulary?
* What is the size of the vocabulary after removing stopwords?
* What is the average sentence length?
* What is the average document length?
* What is the distribution of the number of words in a sentence?
* What is the distribution of the number of sentences in a document?

### Specific Engineering Questions

* What preprocessing steps are needed?
* What is the complexity of the preprocessing steps?
* What can be done to reduce the complexity of the preprocessing steps?
* What data structures are needed to store the data?
* How can ensure my users/audience can replicate my results?

### Objective

In this milestone, you will explore your dataset and build an intuition of the data using descriptive statistics and visualizations.

### Outcomes

You will have a better understanding of your dataset and you will be able to answer the questions above.

## Submission medium

Jupyter Notebook, R Markdown file, or code source file.
