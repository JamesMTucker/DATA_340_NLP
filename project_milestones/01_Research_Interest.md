# Research Interest Statement

## Due date

T Feb 09

## Milestone description


The Research Interest statement is short description of your research topic, some questions you have about your topic, and some implications of your research. You can think about the topic, questions, and implications in the format of: 

* I want to study <YOUR TOPIC HERE> 
    * because <YOUR QUESTIONS HERE> 
    * in order to <YOUR GOALS/IMPLICATIONS HERE>.
    
Please reach out if you have further questions, either here, direct message, or email. I will not hold you to your research interest. You can change it in the future if you find something another topic that interests you.


### Objective

A research statement will inform me some of the topics that interest you. If I know of any datasets, research, or code libraries that could benefit you, I will share these data with you.

### Outcomes

Begin the process of developing your ideas for a final project.
