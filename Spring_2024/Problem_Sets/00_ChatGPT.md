# Engaging with ChatGPT: A Linguistic Exploration

## Due date

February 06, 2024

## Assignment description

As an introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) course, this project aims to explore the intricate relationship between user engagement and the responses generated by an advanced NLP model, specifically ChatGPT. The primary objective of this project is to understand how the phrasing of prompts influences the model's output, emphasizing the concept of "engagement", "understanding", and "knowledge" in the context of human-AI interaction.

In this assignment, you will engage with ChatGPT to explore the nuances of linguistic interaction between humans and AI. The key focus is to analyze how different types of questions and prompts lead to varied responses. You are encouraged to design a series of experiments where you interact with ChatGPT using carefully crafted prompts, each varying in structure, content, and complexity. The goal is to observe how these variations influence the responses in terms of relevance, coherence, and linguistic structure.

### Objectives

1. Understand the fundamentals of NLP and its application in conversational AI.
2. Develop critical thinking skills in framing questions and prompts for AI interaction.
3. Analyze the linguistic and semantic differences in AI responses based on prompt variations.
4. Explore the concept of "engagement" in the context of human-AI communication.

### Tasks

1. **Designing Experiments:** Create a set of diverse prompts, varying in complexity, tone, and subject matter. Include direct, indirect, open-ended, and specific questions.
2. **Interaction and Data Collection:** Engage with ChatGPT using these prompts and record the responses.
3. **Analysis:** Analyze the responses for linguistic properties (syntax, semantics, pragmatics), coherence, relevance to the prompt, and any emergent patterns or anomalies.
4. **Reflection:** Reflect on how the nature of your prompts influenced ChatGPT's responses and what this suggests about AI's understanding of human language.
5. **Aspirations:** Reflect on areas of knowledge in the NLP domain that excite you or areas that you desire to learn in more detail thlroughout this semester.

### Expected Outcome:

A 1-2 report (in Markdown) detailing your experimental design, the interactions, analyses of the responses, and reflections on the role of user engagement in shaping AI responses. The report should include examples of prompts and responses, along with your interpretation of how ChatGPT understands and processes different types of linguistic input. Please conclude your report with a paragraph detailing your aspirations (see 5 above).

Think of this project as a conversation with a very advanced chatbot, ChatGPT. You'll be chatting with it, but with a twist. You're going to change up how you talk to itâ€”sometimes asking simple questions, sometimes complex ones, or maybe being super specific or really vague. Then, you'll see how it replies differently based on what you said. It's like figuring out how your way of talking changes the conversation.

This project will not only enhance your understanding of NLP and AI but also improve your skills in critical thinking, linguistic analysis, and using Gen AI as a tool.
