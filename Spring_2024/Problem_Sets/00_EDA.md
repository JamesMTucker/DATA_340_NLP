Date Due: February 23, 2024

## Context

The [dataset available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/hillary-clinton-emails) contains a trove of emails from Hillary Clinton's private email server, released by the U.S. Department of State in response to [FOIA](https://www.foia.gov/) requests. These emails span a wide range of topics, from international diplomacy to personal scheduling. The dataset is not only a rich source for political and historical analysis but also presents a unique opportunity to apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand patterns, topics, and the network of communication within these emails.

## Objective

The primary objective of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) project is to uncover insights from Hillary Clinton's emails using NLP and statistical methods. The project aims to:

- Identify the common topics discussed using TF-IDF
- Understand the network of senders and recipients to identify key figures and their relationships.
- Explore the frequency and patterns of email communications over time.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: This initial step involves cleaning the dataset for analysis, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing date formats. NLP-specific preprocessing will also be necessary, such as tokenization, removing stopwords, and lemmatization.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Employing statistical and visualization techniques to summarize the dataset's main characteristics. This includes analyzing the distribution of emails over time, the most frequent senders and recipients, and the length of emails.

3. **TF-IDF**: Using NLP techniques such as TF-IDF or count vectorization generate a list of the five TF-IDF terms that best describe the emails. This can provide insights into the main topics and themes discussed in the emails.

4. **Temporal Analysis**: Investigate how email communications change over time, identify any patterns or anomalies in the volume of emails sent and received, and correlate these with external events or timelines.

## Deliverables

- **Formal Notebook**: A detailed jupyter notebook documenting the methodology, analysis, findings, and conclusions. This report should also include a discussion on the implications of the findings and potential areas for further research.
