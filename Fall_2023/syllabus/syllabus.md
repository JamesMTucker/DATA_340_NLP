## Programming language

This course is language agnostic. You can submit your homework and project in whatever programming language you prefer. In class lectures, we will use Python, R, or Mojo ï¿½ for the most part.

## Course objectives:

* Understand the basics of natural language processing techniques and how they can be used to build programs that model human use of language and generate human language.
* Learn how to use natural language processing tools and libraries to perform tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and text generation.
* Develop the ability and experience to design and implement natural language processing systems for real-world applications
* Explore ethical and social implications of natural language processing and artificial intelligence
