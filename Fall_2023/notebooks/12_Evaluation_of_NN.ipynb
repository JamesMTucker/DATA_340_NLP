    "In this lecture, we will discuss how to evaluate language models. We have already discussed precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score. We will introduce the concepts of overfitting, underfitting, generalization, and optimal training scenarios. First, We will refresh our memory on precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score, and then we will introduce the various training scenarios. To conclude, we will discuss some Cross Validation techniques. We will also introduce the python package _Weights and Biases_."

    "# Vector Semantics and Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), vectorizing text is a crucial step that enables machines to understand and process human language. The essence of vectorization lies in transforming textual data into numerical format, particularly into vectors in a multidimensional space, making it amenable to mathematical and computational treatment. A variety of vectorization techniques have been developed over time, and among them, Word2Vec, GloVe, ELMo, and GPT vectors are significant. Below is a discussion on these techniques with a special focus on how GPT vectors address certain challenges associated with ELMo vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Word2Vec:\n",
    "Word2Vec, pioneered by Google, employs neural networks to learn word embeddings from a corpus of text. It encapsulates two architectures: Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram. CBOW predicts a word given its context, while Skip-gram does the opposite. The resultant vectors capture semantic relationships among words, which is manifest in the form of vector arithmetic enabling analogies like \"king - man + woman = queen\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### GloVe:\n",
    "The Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) technique, developed by Stanford, amalgamates the benefits of count-based methods (like Latent Semantic Analysis) and predictive methods (like Word2Vec). It constructs a co-occurrence matrix from a corpus and then factorizes this matrix to obtain word vectors. This method effectively captures both statistical information and semantic relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ELMo:\n",
    "Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo), unlike its predecessors, introduces the notion of contextualized word embeddings. It leverages a bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to create embeddings, accounting for the context in which a word appears. This means the vector for a word can vary depending on its surrounding text, capturing nuances like polysemy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GPT Vectors:\n",
    "The Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) goes a step further by employing Transformer architectures, which are known for their parallel processing capability, making them faster and more scalable compared to LSTMs used by ELMo. GPT is trained on a large corpus of text in an unsupervised manner, and its vector representations are obtained from a fine-tuning process on specific tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, addressing the transition from ELMo to GPT, one of the primary issues with ELMo vectors is their dependency on recurrent networks (LSTMs), which are inherently sequential, thus limiting the scalability and speed of processing. GPT, with its Transformer architecture, overcomes this by enabling parallel processing of sequences. This architectural transition significantly boosts the efficiency and scalability of processing large text corpora. Furthermore, GPT's training process, which initially involves unsupervised pre-training on a vast corpus followed by supervised fine-tuning on specific tasks, has proven to be a powerful paradigm for various NLP applications. This dual-stage training process also contributes to GPT's ability to generate more nuanced and contextually rich word embeddings compared to ELMo.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Informal Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of vectorizing text like turning words into a sort of code that computers can understand better. Word2Vec and GloVe were early methods to do this, with Word2Vec being like a smart guesser of words based on their buddies, while GloVe was a smart counter of how often words hung out together. ELMo came along and said, \"Hey, the meaning of a word can change depending on who it's hanging out with,\" so it used a special network to figure that out. But this network was kind of slow, especially with a lot of words. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then GPT came along with a new, faster setup that could look at all the words at once instead of one by one. It also had a cool two-step training dance that made it really good at understanding text. So, in a way, GPT was like the cool, new, speedy kid on the block that learned from everyone and got even better at understanding the context around words, which was something ELMo was trying to do, but GPT did it faster and better.\n"
