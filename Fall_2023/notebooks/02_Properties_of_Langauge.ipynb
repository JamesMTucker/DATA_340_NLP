    "\n",
    "Linguistic collocations refer to sequences of words that co-occur more often than would be expected by chance. Testing the significance of collocations is a common task in computational linguistics and Natural Language Processing (NLP). There are several statistical measures used to test the significance of collocations. Some of the most common ones include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mutual Information (MI)**:\n",
    "   $$ MI(w_1, w_2) = \\log_2 \\left( \\frac{P(w_1, w_2)}{P(w_1) \\times P(w_2)} \\right) $$\n",
    "   where \\( P(w_1, w_2) \\) is the probability of the words \\( w_1 \\) and \\( w_2 \\) occurring together, and \\( P(w_1) \\) and \\( P(w_2) \\) are the probabilities of the words \\( w_1 \\) and \\( w_2 \\) occurring independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Chi-squared Test**:\n",
    "   The chi-squared test compares the observed frequency of a collocation to the expected frequency if the two words were independent. The formula is:\n",
    "   $$ \\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}} $$\n",
    "   where \\( O_{ij} \\) is the observed frequency of the words \\( w_1 \\) and \\( w_2 \\) occurring together, and \\( E_{ij} \\) is the expected frequency if the two words were independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **T-score**:\n",
    "   $$ T(w_1, w_2) = \\frac{f(w_1, w_2) - E(f(w_1, w_2))}{\\sqrt{f(w_1, w_2)}} $$\n",
    "   where \\( f(w_1, w_2) \\) is the observed frequency of the collocation, and \\( E(f(w_1, w_2)) \\) is the expected frequency under the assumption of independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR)**:\n",
    "   This is a more complex measure that compares the likelihood of the observed data under two different models: one where the words are independent and one where they are dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other measures as well, but these are among the most commonly used in the field of NLP. The choice of measure often depends on the specific task and the nature of the data."

    "We learned from our analysis of Zipf's law that the most frequently occuring terms (bag of words) offer little information about how topics are discussed. We can get a little of an idea of what topics might be discussed by the frequencies of a given term. But we often want and need to do more to analyze a document and its language. So, we created N-grams. We saw that an N-gram methodology provides more information about how language was used in a document. Plotting the various distributions of the linguistic data might lead us to ask important questions. Yet, there are other useful metrics to extract a document's relevant terms: Term-frequency inverse document frequency."

       "<table><tr><td>Guest Series | Dr. Paul Conti: How to Improve Your Mental Health This is episode 2 of a 4-part special series on mental health with Dr. Paul Conti, M.D., a Stanford and Harvard-trained psychiatrist currently running a clinical practice, the Pacific Premier Group. Dr. Conti explains specific tools for how to overcome life’s challenges using a framework of self-inquiry that explores all the key elements of self, including defense mechanisms, behaviors, self-awareness and attention. We also discuss our internal driving forces, how to align them and ultimately, how to cultivate a powerful “generative drive” of positive, aspirational pursuits. Dr. Conti also explains how to adjust your internal narratives, reduce self-limiting concepts, overcome intrusive thoughts, and how certain defense mechanisms, such as “acting out” or narcissism, show up in ourselves and others. The next episode in this special series explores how to build healthy relationships with others.</td><td>['guest', 'series', 'dr.', 'paul', 'conti', 'how', 'to', 'improve', 'your', 'mental', 'health', 'this', 'be', 'episode', '2', 'of', 'a', '4', 'part', 'special', 'series', 'on', 'mental', 'health', 'with', 'dr.', 'paul', 'conti', 'm.d.', 'a', 'stanford', 'and', 'harvard', 'train', 'psychiatrist', 'currently', 'run', 'a', 'clinical', 'practice', 'the', 'pacific', 'premier', 'group', 'dr.', 'conti', 'explain', 'specific', 'tool', 'for', 'how', 'to', 'overcome', 'life', '’s', 'challenge', 'use', 'a', 'framework', 'of', 'self', 'inquiry', 'that', 'explore', 'all', 'the', 'key', 'element', 'of', 'self', 'include', 'defense', 'mechanism', 'behavior', 'self', 'awareness', 'and', 'attention', 'we', 'also', 'discuss', 'our', 'internal', 'driving', 'force', 'how', 'to', 'align', 'they', 'and', 'ultimately', 'how', 'to', 'cultivate', 'a', 'powerful', 'generative', 'drive', 'of', 'positive', 'aspirational', 'pursuit', 'dr.', 'conti', 'also', 'explain', 'how', 'to', 'adjust', 'your', 'internal', 'narrative', 'reduce', 'self', 'limit', 'concept', 'overcome', 'intrusive', 'thought', 'and', 'how', 'certain', 'defense', 'mechanism', 'such', 'as', 'act', 'out', 'or', 'narcissism', 'show', 'up', 'in', 'ourselves', 'and', 'other', 'the', 'next', 'episode', 'in', 'this', 'special', 'series', 'explore', 'how', 'to', 'build', 'healthy', 'relationship', 'with', 'other']</td></tr></table>"
