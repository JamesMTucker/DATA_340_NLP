# W&M DATA 340 4 Natural Language Processing, Fall 2023 Syllabus

[Schedule](#Schedule) | [Email Instructor](mailto:jmtucker02@wm.edu)

## Course overview

This course is designed to introduce students to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its applications in academic research, data science, and industry. Students will learn how to use natural language processing techniques to gain a deeper understanding of a research question and/or topic.

## Course venue and time

- Integrated Science Center, room 1280. Tuesdays (T) and Thursdays (Th) 5:00 - 6:20
- See course in Blackboard

## Instructor contact and office hours

- email: jmtucker02@wm.edu or j.tucker@mail.utoronto.ca
- website: https://jamesmtucker.com
- Office hours by appointment only

## Programming language

This course is language agnostic. You can submit your homework and project in whatever programming language you prefer. In class lectures, we will use Python, R, or Mojo for the most part.

## Course objectives

- Understand the basics of natural language processing techniques and how they can be used to build programs that model human use of language and generate human language
- Learn how to use natural language processing tools and libraries to perform tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and text generation
- Develop the ability and experience to design and implement natural language processing systems for real-world applications
- Explore ethical and social implications of natural language processing and artificial intelligence

## Course topics

1. Introduction to natural language processing
2. Data set creation and documentation
3. Text preprocessing and cleaning
4. Text classification and sentiment analysis
5. Neural Networks, Transformers, Large Language Models
6. Ethical and social implications of natural language processing and artificial intelligence

## Assignments

All assignments are posted [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/JamesMTucker/DATA_340_NLP) and links are provided in Blackboard.

- NLP Problem sets (35%) - these are smaller assignments designed to reinforce the ideas discussed in lecture or the assigned reading. These assignments will be posted on the course GitHub repo and Blackboard and are due at the specified date and time.
  - [Problem set 0: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) or Critical Reflection on the use of terms such as 'understanding' and 'intelligence' in the context of NLP](../Fall_2023/problem_sets/problem_set_0.md) (5%)
  - Problem set 1: Machine Learning Models for NLP (10%)
  - Problem set 2: Vector semantics (10%)
  - Problem set 3: Neural Networks for NLP (10%)
- Project (50%) - The student will develop a project related to their area of interest and use NLP techniques to explore a data set in consideration with some research questions.
  - Project code, documentation, and report (40% of the 50) - in the overall development of the project. It is hoped that the student will create a GitHub repo to host their code and documentation. The student should expect to submit project code that is well-documented and reproducible. The research findings should be presented in a report that is well-written and well-organized.
  - Project presentation (10% of the 50) - In the final class sessions, each student will present a short presentation of their projects.
- Course preparation (15%) - It is expected that the student will come to class with having read the assigned readings and/or other additional code documentation.
