# W&M DATA 340 4 Natural Language Processing, Spring 2024 Syllabus

[Schedule](#Schedule) | [Email Instructor](mailto:jmtucker02@wm.edu)

## Course overview

This course is designed to introduce students to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its applications in academic research, data science, and industry. Students will learn how to use natural language processing techniques to gain a deeper understanding of a research question and/or topic.

## Course venue and time

- Integrated Science Center, room 1280. Tuesdays (T) and Thursdays (Th) 5:00 - 6:20
- See course in Blackboard

## Instructor contact and office hours

- email: jmtucker02@wm.edu
- website: https://jamesmtucker.com
- Office hours by appointment only

## Programming language

This course is language agnostic. You can submit your homework and project in whatever programming language you prefer. In class lectures, we will use Python, R, or Mojo for the most part.

## Tools

Students are encouraged to utilize generative AI tools when they are stuck on implementing code or ideating on topics for projects. If you copy code from a generative AI tool, like ChatGPT or GitHub CoPilot, please provide a comment in your programming language's comment syntax that you resourced a tool to solve your problem. If you resourced Stack Overflow or another source, please footnote your sources accordingly.

## Course objectives

- Understand the basics of natural language processing techniques and how they can be used to in data driven decision models
- Learn how to use natural language processing tools and libraries to perform tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and text generation
- Develop the ability and experience to design and implement natural language processing systems for real-world applications
- Explore ethical and social implications of natural language processing and artificial intelligence

## Course topics

1. Introduction to natural language processing
2. Data set creation and documentation
3. Text preprocessing and cleaning
4. Text classification and sentiment analysis
5. Neural Networks, Transformers, Large Language Models
6. Ethical and social implications of natural language processing and artificial intelligence

## Assignments

### Descriptions

There are a possible 165 points to earn in this course.

All assignments are posted [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/JamesMTucker/DATA_340_NLP) and links are provided in Blackboard.

- Understanding NLP (10pts) - A conversation with ChatGPT about Linguistics, NLP, and Data Science
- Course reading (15pts) - Please read the required readings listed in the course syllabus. Lecture topics will parallel the reading and the readings will help you comprehend the subject matter in greater detail.
- NLP Problem sets (100pts) - these assignments are designed to reinforce the ideas discussed in lecture or the assigned reading. Whereas the student can expect to solve the problem sets from the topics covered in lecture, it is encouraged that the student explore additional solutions and creative thinking.

  - Problem set 0: Exploratory Data Analysis in a NLP context - Distributions and Features
  - Problem set 1: Semantic Search Engine - king is to queen as man is to ?
  - Problem set 2: Author prediction Dataset (a) - Federalist Papers
  - Problem set 3: Author prediction RNN and Transformer Models (b) - Federalist Papers
  - Problem set 4: Fine-tuning models for task-specific objectives

- [Final Project (40pts)](../Spring_2024/syllabus/09_Project.md) - Demonstrate your mastery of NLP concepts with a topic of your choosing

### Late time currency

You get 4 days of late time. This means that if you cannot turn in an assignment on time, you can use your late time currency to extend a deadline by however many days are needed, not extending beyond 4. You get four days credit. Use the time wisely. If you need more than four days time, you can earn an additional day by completing a coding challenge:

1. [Sparse matrix multiplication]()
2. [Probability of disease]()
3. [Distances]()
4. [Regression tree]()
5. [K-means]()
